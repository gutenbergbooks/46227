<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">DANIEL BOONE</span> was the ideal of the American
pioneer&mdash;brave, cool, self-reliant, a dead
shot with his rifle, a consummate master of woodcraft,
with sturdy frame, hopeful at all times, and
never discouraged by disasters which caused many
a weaker spirit to faint by the way. All that the
pen of romance depicts in the life of one whose
lot is cast in the Western forests, marked the
career of Boone. In the lonely solitudes he
encountered the wild animal and the fiercer wild
man; and he stood on the bastions at Boonesborough
through the flaming sun or the solemn
hours of night, exchanging shots with the treacherous
Shawanoe, when every bullet fired was meant
to extinguish a human life; he was captured by
Indians three times, his companions were shot
down at his side, his daughter was carried away
by savages and quickly rescued by himself and
a few intrepid comrades, his oldest boy was shot
dead before he set foot in Kentucky, and another
was killed while bravely fighting at Blue Licks;
the border town named after him was assaulted
and besieged by overwhelming bodies of British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>
and Indians, his brother was slain and he himself
underwent all manner of hardship and suffering.</p>

<p>Yet through it all, he preserved his honest
simplicity, his unswerving integrity, his prudence
and self-possession, and his unfaltering faith in
himself, in the future of his country, and in God.</p>

<p>He lived through this crucial period to see all
his dreams realized, and Kentucky one of the
brightest stars in the grand constellation of the
Union.</p>

<p>Such a life cannot be studied too closely by
American youth; and in the following pages, we
have endeavored to give an accurate description of
its opening, its eventful progress and its peaceful
close, when, in the fullness of time and in a ripe
old age, he was finally laid to rest, honored and
revered by the great nation whose possessions
stretch from ocean to ocean, and whose "land is
the fairest that ever sun shone on!"</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Birth of Daniel Boone&mdash;Fondness for Hunting&mdash;An Alarming
Absence&mdash;A Pedagogue of the Olden Time&mdash;Sudden Termination
of Young Boone's School Education&mdash;Removal to
North Carolina&mdash;Boone's Marriage&mdash;His Children.</p></blockquote>

<p>Daniel Boone was born in Exeter township,
Bucks county, Pennsylvania, on the 11th of February,
1735, so that he was just three years the junior
of Washington.</p>

<p>Daniel had six brothers and four sisters, he being
the fourth child of Squire Boone, whose father
landed at Philadelphia from England, October 10,
1717, bringing with him two daughters and nine
sons. The township of Exeter, as it is now known
in Pennsylvania, was named by the elder Boone
after the city in England near which he was born.</p>

<p>There is good authority for believing that the
Boone family, when living in the mother country,
were attached to the Established Church; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
when they had resided some time amid the peaceful
surroundings and gentle influences of the friends
and followers of George Fox, they inclined to their
religious belief, though it will hardly be claimed
that Daniel Boone continued orthodox throughout
his adventurous life.</p>

<p>In those days, the educational advantages given
youth were very meagre, and frequently none at
all. The old-time pedagogue was a man stern and
repelling to children, knowing little of the true
means of imparting knowledge. About the only
branch he handled with any skill was that which
came from the nearest tree; and, had he possessed
the ability to teach, he lacked, in the generality of
cases, the education necessary.</p>

<p>A century and a half ago, Exeter township
abounded with game, and the town itself was a
pioneer settlement of the most primitive order,
consisting of log-houses almost entirely surrounded
by forests, in whose depths roamed bears, panthers,
deer, and the smaller game so attractive to sportsmen.</p>

<p>It was these which were to educate young Boone
more than were the crude means and the tippling
teacher in whose charge he was placed. Nothing
delighted the lad more than to wander for hours
through the woods, gun in hand, stealing among the
cool shadows, behind the mossy rocks and along
the purling streams, with the soft tread of the
Indian, while the keen eyes of the young hunter
searched tree-top and bush for the first signs of
game, and his ear was ever strained to catch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
cautious footstep of the wild beast as it crept faintly
over the leaves.</p>

<p>Thus in the grand school of Nature was the
great pioneer trained. While yet a small boy, he
became noted for his unerring aim with the rifle,
and the skill with which he read the "signs"
among the trees, that were as closed volumes to
others.</p>

<p>The privilege of wandering with gun and dog
was all the happiness he asked, and as an inevitable
consequence of this mode of life, he grew sturdy,
strong, active, and capable of immense exertion
without fatigue. It is in just such nurseries as this
that the great explorers and pioneers of the world
are educated.</p>

<p>One morning, Daniel shouldered his rifle, and
whistling to his dog, the two plunged into the
woods for one of their usual hunts. The sun was
just rising in a clear sky, the air was crisp and invigorating,
and the prospect was all that the heart
of the young hunter could wish. Those of his relatives
who saw him depart thought nothing of it,
for the sight was a very common one with him and
his brothers, and young as they were, they learned
among the rudiments of their training the great
fundamental truth to trust in God and themselves.</p>

<p>As the shades of night closed over settlement
and forest, the boy Daniel was expected home,
though the family had no special misgiving when
the hours passed without bringing him, it being
supposed that he had penetrated so far into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
wilds that he preferred to encamp for the night
rather than take the long tramp home.</p>

<p>But, when the second day had passed, and he
failed to appear, the parents were in great distress,
for it seemed certain that some fatal accident must
have overtaken their child. The mature and experienced
hunter is always in peril from wild beasts
or the wilder human beings who prowl and skulk
through the wilderness, and many a man who has
braved the dangers of a score of years, has fallen a
victim to the treacherous biped or quadruped, who
has sought his life with greater cunning than he has
done his own work.</p>

<p>It was impossible therefore for them to feel anything
but the most painful anxiety for their boy,
and, unable to remain idle longer, they called upon
their neighbors, and a search-party was organized.</p>

<p>The trail made by the lad was too faint to be followed
successfully, and the parties scattered and
hunted for traces as best they could.</p>

<p>Hours passed by, every man doing his utmost to
discover the fate of the boy, who they hoped was
still living somewhere in the depths of the wilderness,
though it would seem scarcely possible that,
if alive, he was not in a suffering or helpless condition.</p>

<p>But the shouts and reports of their guns remained
unanswered, and they pushed forward,
hoping against hope. The bonds of sympathy
are nowhere stronger than in such frontier settlements,
where a common feeling of brotherhood
exists, and the men who were searching for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
lost Daniel, were hardly less anxious concerning
him than were the parents themselves.</p>

<p>Suddenly someone descried a faint, thin column
of smoke rising from a nondescript sort of structure,
and hurrying toward it, they saw one of the
most primitive of cabins, made of limbs and brush
and sods of grass piled together. Stealing around
to the rude entrance, they peeped in, and saw
Daniel himself, looking like an old hunter who had
settled down for the season. On the earth-floor of
his structure were strewn the skins of the game he
had shot, while he was cooking the choicest pieces
before the smoking fire. He was only three miles
from home, but it might as well have been a hundred,
for all the additional comfort it afforded his
friends and parents.</p>

<p>The lad looked up with an expression of surprise,
wondering what all the excitement was about; and
when he found they were hunting for him, it was
hard to understand the necessity for doing any
such thing.</p>

<p>It was not the first time he had been alone in
the woods, and he thought he was as well able to
take care of himself as were any of the older pioneers
who came to look for him. However, as he
was a dutiful son, and had no wish to cause his
parents any unnecessary alarm, he gathered up his
game and peltries, and went back home with the
hunters.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more pleasant to the American
boy than just such a life as that followed by Daniel
Boone&mdash;wandering for hours through the wilderness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
on the look-out for game, building the cheery
camp-fire deep in some glen or gorge, quaffing the
clear icy water from some stream, or lying flat on
the back and looking up through the tree-tops at
the patches of blue sky, across which the snowy
ships of vapor are continually sailing.</p>

<p>But any parent who would allow a child to follow
the bewitching pleasures of such a life, would
commit a sinful neglect of duty, and would take
the surest means of bringing regret, sorrow, and
trouble to the boy himself, when he should come to
manhood.</p>

<p>The parents of young Boone, though they were
poor, and had the charge of a large family, did
their utmost to give their children the rudiments
of a common school education, with the poor advantages
that were at their command.</p>

<p>It is said that about the first thing Daniel's
teacher did, after summoning his boys and girls
together in the morning, was to send them out
again for a recess&mdash;one of the most popular proceedings
a teacher can take, though it cannot be
considered a very great help in their studies.</p>

<p>While the pupils were enjoying themselves to
their fullest bent, the master took a stroll into the
woods, from which he was always sure to return
much more crabbed than when he went, and with
his breath smelling very strongly of something
stronger than water.</p>

<p>At times he became so mellowed, that he was
indulgence itself, and at other times he beat the
boys unmercifully. The patrons of the school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
seemed to think their duty ended with the sending
of their children to the school-house, without inquiring
what took place after they got there.</p>

<p>One day Daniel asked the teacher for permission
to go out-doors, and receiving it, he passed into
the clear air just at the moment that a brown
squirrel was running along the branch of a fallen
tree.</p>

<p>Instantly the athletic lad darted in pursuit, and,
when the nimble little animal whisked out of sight
among a dense clump of vine and bushes, the boy
shoved his hand in, in the hope of catching it. Instead
of doing so, he touched something cold and
smooth, and bringing it forth, found it was a whiskey
bottle with a goodly quantity of the fiery fluid
within.</p>

<p>"That's what the teacher comes out here for,"
thought Daniel, as his eyes sparkled, "and that's
why he is so cross when he comes back."</p>

<p>He restored the bottle to its place, and returned
to the school-room, saying nothing to any one until
after dismissal, when he told his discovery to some
of the larger boys, who, like all school-children,
were ever ripe for mischief.</p>

<p>When such a group fall into a discussion, it may
be set down as among the certainties that something
serious to some one is sure to be the result.</p>

<p>The next morning the boys put a good charge of
tartar emetic in the whiskey bottle, and shaking it
up, restored it to its former place of concealment.
Then, full of eager expectation, they hurried into
school, where they were more studious than ever&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>a
suspicious sign which ought to have attracted
the notice of the teacher, though it seems not to
have done so.</p>

<p>The Irish instructor took his walk as usual, and
when he came back and resumed labor, it may be
imagined that the boys were on the tip-toe of expectation.</p>

<p>They had not long to wait. The teacher grew
pale, and gave signs of some revolution going on
internally. But he did not yield to the feeling.
As might have been expected, however, it increased
his fretfulness, and whether he suspected the truth
or not, he punished the boys most cruelly, as
though seeking to work off his illness by exercising
himself with the rod upon the backs of the lads,
whose only consolation was in observing that the
medicine taken unconsciously by the irate teacher
was accomplishing its mission.</p>

<p>Matters became worse and worse, and the whippings
of the teacher were so indiscriminate and
brutal, that a rebellion was excited. The crisis
was reached when he assailed Daniel, who struggled
desperately, encouraged by the uproar and
shouts of the others, until he finally got the upper
hand of the master, and gave him an unquestionable
trouncing.</p>

<p>After such a proceeding it was not to be expected
that any sort of discipline could be maintained,
and the rest of the pupils rushed out-doors and
scattered to their homes.</p>

<p>The news of the outbreak quickly spread through
the neighborhood, and Daniel was taken to task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
by his father for his insubordination, though the
parent now saw that the teacher possessed not the
first qualification for his position. And the instructor
himself must have felt somewhat the same
way, for he made no objections when he was notified
of his dismissal, and the school education of
Daniel Boone ended.</p>

<p>It was a misfortune to him, as it is to any one,
to be deprived of the privilege of storing his mind
with the knowledge that is to be acquired from
books, and yet, in another sense, it was an advantage
to the sturdy boy, who gained the better opportunity
for training himself for the great work
which lay before him.</p>

<p>In the woods of Exeter he hunted more than
ever, educating the eye, ear, and all the senses to
that wonderful quickness which seems incredible
when simply told of a person. He became a dead
shot with his rifle, and laid the foundations of
rugged health, strength and endurance, which
were to prove so invaluable to him in after years,
when he should cross the Ohio, and venture into the
perilous depths of the Dark and Bloody Ground.</p>

<p>Boone grew into a natural athlete, with all his
faculties educated to the highest point of excellence.
He assisted his father as best he could,
but he was a Nimrod by nature, instinct and
education, and while yet a boy, he became known
for miles around the settlement as a most skilled,
daring, and successful hunter.</p>

<p>When he had reached young manhood, his father
removed to North Carolina, settling near Holman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Ford, on the Yadkin river, some eight
miles from Wilkesboro'. Here, as usual, the boy
assisted his parents, who were gifted with a large
family, as was generally the case with the pioneers,
so that there was rarely anything like affluence attained
by those who helped to build up our country.</p>

<p>While the Boones lived on the banks of the
Yadkin, Daniel formed the acquaintance of Rebecca
Bryan, whom he married, according to the
best authority attainable, in the year 1755, when
he was about twenty years of age.</p>

<p>There is a legend which has been told many a
time to the effect that Boone, while hunting, mistook
the bright eyes of a young lady for those of
a deer, and that he came within a hair's-breadth of
sending a ball between them with his unerring
rifle, before he discovered his mistake. But the
legend, like that of Jessie Brown at Lucknow and
many others in which we delight, has no foundation
in fact, and so far as known there was no
special romance connected with the marriage of
Boone to the excellent lady who became his
partner for life.</p>

<p>The children born of this marriage were James,
Israel, Jesse, Daniel, Nathan, Susan, Jemima, Lavinia,
and Rebecca.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Social Disturbances in North Carolina&mdash;Eve of the American
Revolution&mdash;Boone's Excursions to the West&mdash;Inscription on
a Tree&mdash;Employed by Henderson and Company&mdash;The "Regulators"
of North Carolina&mdash;Dispersed by Governor Tryon&mdash;John
Finley&mdash;Resolution to go West.</p></blockquote>

<p>The early part of Daniel Boone's married life
was uneventful, and the years glided by without
bringing any incident, event or experience to him
worthy the pen of the historian. He toiled faithfully
to support his growing family, and spent a
goodly portion of his time in the woods, with his
rifle and dog, sometimes camping on the bank of
the lonely Yadkin, or floating down its smooth
waters in the stillness of the delightful afternoon,
or through the solemn quiet of the night, when
nothing but the stars were to be seen twinkling
overhead.</p>

<p>But Daniel Boone was living in stirring times,
and there were signs in the political heavens of
tremendous changes approaching. There was war
between England and France; there was strife
along the frontier, where the Indian fought fiercely
against the advancing army of civilization, and the
spirit of resistance to the tyranny of the mother
country was growing rapidly among the sturdy
colonists. North Carolina began, through her representatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
in legislature, those measures of opposition
to the authority of Great Britain, which forecast
the active part the Old Pine Tree State was to
take in the revolutionary struggle for liberty and
independence.</p>

<p>During the few years that followed there was
constant quarreling between the royal governor
and the legislators, and it assumed such proportions
that the State was kept in continual ferment.
This unrest and disturbance were anything but
pleasing to Boone, who saw the country settling
rapidly around him, and who began to look toward
the West with the longing which comes over the
bird when it gazes yearningly out from the bars of
its cage at the green fields, cool woods, and enchanting
landscapes in which its companions are
singing and reveling with delight.</p>

<p>Boone took long hunting excursions toward the
West, though nothing is known with exact certainty
as to the date when he began them. The Cherokee
war which had caused much trouble along the Carolina
frontier was ended, and he and others must
have turned their thoughts many a time to the
boundless forests which stretched for hundreds
and thousands of miles towards the setting sun, in
which roamed countless multitudes of wild animals
and still wilder beings, who were ready to dispute
every foot of advance made by the white settlers.</p>

<p>Such a vast field could not but possess an irresistible
attraction to a consummate hunter like
Boone, and the glimpses which the North Carolina
woods gave of the possibilities awaiting him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the growth of empire in the West, were sure to produce
the result that came when he had been married
some fifteen or more years and was in the
prime of life.</p>

<p>Previous to this date, the well known abundance
of game in Tennessee led many hunters to make
incursions into the territory. They sometimes
formed large companies, uniting for the prospect
of gain and greater protection against the ever-present
danger from Indians.</p>

<p>It is mentioned by good authority, that among
the parties thus venturing over the Carolina border
into the wilderness, was one at the head of which
was "Daniel Boone from the Yadkin, in North
Carolina, who traveled with them as low as the
place where Abingdon now stands, and there left
them."</p>

<p>Some years ago the following description could
be deciphered upon an old beech-tree standing between
Jonesboro and Blountsville:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<pre>
           D. BOON
CILLED      A. BAR      ON
IN            THE     TREE
YEAR        1760.
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>This inscription is generally considered as proof
that Boone made hunting excursions to that region
at that early date, though the evidence can hardly
be accepted as positive on the point.</p>

<p>It was scarcely a year after the date named, however,
that Boone, who was still living on the Yadkin,
entered the same section of the country, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
been sent thither by Henderson &amp; Company for
the purposes of exploration. He was accompanied
by Samuel Callaway, a relative, and the ancestor
of many of the Callaways of Tennessee, Kentucky,
and Missouri. The latter was at the side of Boone
when, approaching a spur of the Cumberland mountains,
upon whose slopes they saw multitudes of
bisons grazing, the great pioneer paused, and
surveying the scene for a moment, exclaimed, with
kindling eyes:</p>

<p>"I am richer than He who owned the cattle on a
thousand hills, for I own the wild beasts of a thousand
valleys."</p>

<p>The sight was indeed one which might have stirred
the heart of a hunter who could grasp the possibilities
of the future of those favored regions.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone may be considered as having undergone
a preliminary training from his earliest boyhood
for the work which has identified his name
indissolubly with the history of Kentucky. He
was what may be called a born pioneer, but there
were causes at work in North Carolina which led to
his departure for the Kentucky wilderness, of which
the general reader is apt to lose sight in studying
his character.</p>

<p>The approach of the American Revolution in the
former State, as in many others, was marked by
social disturbances frequently amounting to anarchy.
There were many Scotch traders, who had
accumulated considerable wealth without having
gone through the labor and perils which the natives
underwent in providing for their families.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
These foreigners adopted an expensive and showy
style of living, altogether out of keeping with the
severe simplicity that marked that of the colonists.</p>

<p>Nothing was more natural than that this assumption
of superiority in the way of social position
should roil and excite resentment among those less
favored by fortune.</p>

<p>They were not alone in this offensive course: the
officers and agents of the Royal Government were
equally ostentatious in display and manner of living,
and the exasperating snobbishness spread to the
magistrates, lawyers, clerks of court, and tax gatherers,
who demanded exorbitant fees for their services.
The clergymen of the Established Church
became oppressive in their exactions, and, as we
have stated, society itself was threatened with revolution
before the rattle of musketry at Bunker
Hill "was heard around the world."</p>

<p>Petitions were sent to the Legislature for relief
by the suffering citizens, who were in much the
same distressing situation in which Ireland has
been many a time since. These prayers were
treated with indifference or open contempt, for
there are none more reckless and blind than those
who are traveling close to the edge of the political
volcano rumbling at their feet.</p>

<p>There is a limit beyond which it is always dangerous
to tempt the endurance of a people, who
now began meeting together, and formed themselves
into associations for correcting the evils
around them. It was these people who received
the name of "Regulators," and who helped to increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
the disturbances in that particular section
of the country. They deliberately decided "to
pay only such taxes as were agreeable to law, and
applied to the purpose therein named, and to pay
no officer more than his legal fees."</p>

<p>The history of the State records many acts of
violence which were inevitable from this condition
of affairs. The final collision between the "Regulators"
and a strong force of the royal governor
Tryon at Alamanance, in which the rebels were
badly defeated, occurred in May, 1771, but the disturbances
continued with more or less violence
until the breaking out of the Revolution, when the
mills of God ground so "exceeding fine," that the
grievances were removed forever.</p>

<p>It was in such a community as this that Daniel
Boone lived, and he and his family were sufferers.
What more natural than that he should cast his
eyes longingly toward the West, where, though
there might be wild beasts and wild men, he and
his loved ones could be free from the exasperating
annoyances which were all around them?</p>

<p>The perils from Indians were much less alarming
to them than were those of the tax-gatherer. Indeed,
in all probability, it lent an additional attractiveness
to the vast expanse of virgin wilderness,
with its splashing streams, its rich soil, its abundance
of game and all that is so enchanting to the
real sportsman, who finds an additional charm in
the knowledge that the pleasure upon which he
proposes to enter is spiced with personal danger.</p>

<p>One day a visitor dropped in upon Boone. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
was John Finley, who led a party of hunters to the
region adjoining the Louisa River in Kentucky in
the winter of 1767, where they spent the season
in hunting and trapping. The hunter called upon
Boone to tell him about that land in which he knew
his friend was so much interested.</p>

<p>We can imagine the young man, with his rifle
suspended on the deer-prongs over the fire, with
his wife busy about her household duties and his
children at play, sitting in his cabin and listening
to the glowing narrative of one who knew whereof
he was speaking.</p>

<p>Finley told him of the innumerable game, the
deer and bison, the myriads of wild turkeys, and
everything so highly prized by the sportsman; he
pictured the vast stretches of forest in which the
hunter could wander for hours and days without
striking a clearing; of the numerous streams, some
large, some small, and all lovely to the eye, and it
needed no very far-seeing vision to forecast the
magnificent future which lay before this highly
favored region.</p>

<p>It must have been a winsome picture drawn by
Finley&mdash;aided as it was by the repelling coloring
of the scene of his actual surroundings&mdash;made so
hateful by the oppressive agents of the foreign government
which claimed the colonies as her own.</p>

<p>When Finley was through, and he had answered
all of his friend's questions, and told him of his
many hunting adventures in Kentucky, Boone announced
that he would go with him when he should
make his next visit. He had already been drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
strongly toward the region, and he wished to see
with his own eyes the favored land, before removing
his family thither.</p>

<p>The acquisition of such a person was so desirable,
that he was sure to be appreciated by those who
knew him best, and whether appointed to that position
or not, his own matchless resources and
natural powers were certain to fix upon him as
the leader of the adventurous characters who had
decided to explore the dangerous wilderness of
Kentucky.</p>

Enchanting View&mdash;A Site for the Camp&mdash;Unsurpassed
Hunting&mdash;An Impressive Solitude&mdash;No Signs of Indians.</p></blockquote>

<p>Daniel Boone now entered upon that epoch in
his life, which has interwoven his name with the
history of Kentucky, and indeed with the settlement
of the West, for though he was not venturing
into the wilderness with the intention of remaining
there, yet his purpose of "spying out the land"
was simply the first step in his career of pioneer of
the Dark and Bloody Ground.</p>

<p>The party of exploration, or rather of hunting,
numbered a half dozen: John Finley, James Moncey,
John Stuart, William Cool, Joseph Holden,
and Daniel Boone, who was chosen the leader.
It was a strong company, for all the men were experienced
hunters, unerring rifle-shots, and well
aware of the dangers they were to encounter.</p>

<p>On the first of May, 1769, the party set out for
Kentucky in high spirits, and eagerly anticipating
the enjoyment that was to be theirs, before they
should return from the all-important expedition.</p>

<p>They had selected the most enchanting season
of the year, and it is easy to imagine with what
glowing anticipation they ventured upon the journey,
which was to be more eventful, indeed, than
any member of it imagined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
It was a long distance from North Carolina,
across the intervening stretch of stream, forest and
mountain, to Kentucky, with all the temptations
to the hunter to turn aside, temptations which it is
safe to conclude overcame them many a time, for,
when a full month had passed, not one of the
party had stepped within the confines of the Dark
and Bloody Ground.</p>

<p>But, though they were moving slowly, they were
steadily nearing the promised land, and on the 7th
of June the men, bronzed and toughened by the exposure
to which they had been subjected, but still
sturdy and resolute, began climbing the precipitous
slope of a mountain on the border of Kentucky.</p>

<p>The six who had left North Carolina more than
a month before were there, attired in their rough
hunting costume, and with their ambition and
purpose as strong as ever. Each wore the hunting-shirt
of the forest ranger made of dressed deerskins.
The leggins were of the same material, and
the feet were protected by strong, comfortably fitting
moccasins. There were fringes down the
seams of the leggins, just as seems to be the
favorite custom with many of the red-men in donning
their picturesque costumes.</p>

<p>Although these dresses might be attractive to
the eye, yet such a purpose was the last that entered
the minds of the wearers, who constructed
them for use only. Their under garments were of
cotton, so coarse that it would have been like sackcloth
to many a man of modern days; they carried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
as a matter of course, the powder-horn, rifle,
hatchet, bullet-pouch, and the other indispensables
of a hunter.</p>

<p>It was near the close of the day, and though the
party were pretty well exhausted, yet they pushed
on, feeling in many respects like those who, for the
first time in their lives, are to gaze upon the land
which is more enchanting to them than all the
world beside.</p>

<p>Ere the sun sank behind the immense expanse
of wilderness, and just when its splendors were illuminating
the skies with the glories of the fading
day, the hunting party reached the summit of the
mountain, and gazed off over Kentucky.</p>

<p>The panorama spread out before them was a most
entrancing one, their vision extending over hundreds
of square miles, with the rich vales watered by
the beautiful streams, the forest alternating with
broad natural clearings, with vast stretches of level
country upon which the myriads of moving
specks were recognized by the experienced eye as
bisons, and over which they knew the deer dashed
and other wild animals roamed with scarcely a fear
of their natural enemy, man. There was many a
league in whose solemn depths a human foot had
never yet penetrated, and whose echoes had never
been awakened by the shot of the rifle. There
they lay as silent as at "creation's morn," and the
denizens of the woods waxed strong and wandered
at will, without fear of the deadly bullet whistling
from behind the tree or mossy rock.</p>

<p>True, among these cool woods and within many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
of the dark recesses the red Indian ventured, and
now and then the sharp whiz of his arrow was
heard, and the barbed weapon flashed among the
green leaves as it pierced the heart of the unsuspecting
natives of the wood.</p>

<p>But where there were such multitudes of wild
beasts these deaths were scarcely noticeable, and
the white hunters knew that it was a sportsman's
paradise that lay spread at their feet.</p>

<p>The picture of these six pioneers who paused on
the crest of the mountain as the sun was setting,
and looked off over the Kentucky wilderness, is
that which has been selected by the artist, who has
immortalized the scene on canvas, and all will agree
that he could not have chosen a more inviting
subject.</p>

<p>The surface upon which they looked down was
rolling, level far beyond, but quite hilly nearer the
base of the mountain, while it all possessed the indescribable
charm of variety, and it could not have
been more enchanting to the wearied spectators.</p>

<p>Finley had been there before, and, though they
may have thought that some of the stories he
told were overdrawn, they could well afford to believe
them now, when they came to gaze upon the
attractive country.</p>

<p>Aye, they stood on the very borders of the land,
and they determined that they would venture
within it on the morrow. Although they had left
home at the most delightful season of the year, yet
the spring proved to be a severe one, and their
journey had been delayed by stormy weather, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
that the glowing panorama at their feet was robed
in more roseate colors from its very contrast to that
through which they had passed so recently.</p>

<p>Assuming positions of rest, the group feasted
their eyes to the full, and we can well imagine the
expressions of delight which escaped them, as they
constantly caught sight of new and novel scenes
and pointed them out to each other.</p>

<p>There lay the region in which they would probably
make their future home, whither they would
bring their families, and where they would encounter
the toil, privation and danger, which invariably
attend the pioneers of every country.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, the time, place and
surroundings were invested with a peculiar interest,
which could not have been theirs at any other
period or under any different conditions.</p>

<p>The sun went down behind the wilderness, and
night gradually overspread the scene. The hunters
had not caught sight of a single human being beside
themselves, and now that darkness had come,
they made their preparations to encamp for the
night.</p>

<p>They were veterans at this business, as they
showed by avoiding such a conspicuous position as
they then occupied. The flash of a camp-fire on
the mountain-top would have been seen for many
miles over the wilderness, and though they had
discovered nothing of the red-men, yet it was
reasonable to suppose that many of them would
look out from the dark recesses at the unwonted
spectacle and would suspect the true cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
And so, from a prudent habit they had formed,
they moved down to a neighboring ravine, where
they camped for the night.</p>

<p>The spot was favorable in every respect, the
gorge being so deep, and surrounded by such a
dense thicket, that the glimmer of the camp-fire
was not likely to be seen by any one, unless he
ventured close enough to hear the murmur of the
voices of the hunters as they gathered together for
their evening meal.</p>

<p>Near them lay a tree that had been uprooted by
some recent storm, and which offered the advantages
the hunters could not fail to appreciate at
sight. The huge trunk was used for the rear wall
of the camp, as it may be termed, while logs and
brush were gathered and piled on two sides, leaving
the front open, where the fire was kindled against
another log. Thus they were secured against any
chill during the cold night, while no wild animal
was likely to venture across the magic ring of fire,
in case he was attracted to the spot.</p>

<p>It was decided not only to make this their resting-place
for the night, but their headquarters
during their visit to Kentucky.</p>

<p>Accordingly, their camp was strengthened, as
may be said, a roof being made more substantial
than ornamental, but sufficient to keep out the
rain, and the front was narrowed in, so that no
matter how sudden or violent the changes of
weather, they were well protected against them.</p>

<p>Their greatest safeguard, however, lay in their
own hardy constitutions and rugged health, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
they had acquired from their active out-door life
long before venturing into this wild region.</p>

<p>This visit to Kentucky was extended all through
the summer and autumn until the dead of winter,
during which time they made the camp in the gorge
their headquarters.</p>

<p>They had many a glorious hunt, as may well be
supposed, and it would be unsafe to estimate the
numbers of bisons, deer, wild turkeys, bear and
other species of game that fell victims to the unerring
marksmen. It is unnecessary to say that
they lived like princes, and grew stronger, sturdier,
and more hopeful. Although separated from their
families to which they were tenderly attached,
there was an indescribable charm about this wild
out-door life that rendered the social annoyances
to which they were subjected at home all the more
distasteful.</p>

<p>They felt that if a band of worthy colonists could
be gathered, and a venture made into Kentucky,
the future was sure to be all they could wish.</p>

<p>Beyond question, this preliminary visit to Kentucky
settled the future not only of Boone himself,
but of others who were associated with him.</p>

<p>It seems an extraordinary statement to make,
and yet it is a fact that, during that entire summer
and autumn and a goodly portion of the winter
which they spent there, they never once saw an
Indian&mdash;the very enemy which it was to be supposed
they would alone dread, and who would be
the most certain to molest them.</p>

<p>When it is remembered that the Indians had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
made so much trouble on the Carolina frontiers,
this is all the more remarkable, until we recollect
that Kentucky at that day, and for years after, was
regarded by the red-men as a sort of neutral hunting
ground, no particular tribe laying claim to it.
But it was territory into which each possessed an
equal right to venture and wage deadly hand-to-hand
encounters&mdash;while all united with an undying
enmity to drive back any white man who presumed
to step foot upon the Dark and Bloody Ground. It
must have been, too, that the Indians scattered
through the region were not expecting any visitors.</p>

<p>Kentucky at that time belonged to the colony
of Virginia. The Shawanoes, Cherokees, and Chickasaws
frequently ventured into the region to hunt,
but the Iroquois had ceded all their claim to the
grounds to Great Britain at Fort Stanwix, in 1768,
so that it will be understood that Boone and his
companions were not venturing into Indian territory
at all, though it is not to be supposed that
any estray red-men whom they might encounter in
their hunts would be likely to regard the exact
status of the matter.</p>

<p>The hunters preferred not to encounter them at
all, but were cautious in their movements, and "put
their trust in God and kept their powder dry."</p>

<p>Accordingly, as we have stated, they prosecuted
their hunting through the sultry summer months,
alternating with storm and sunshine, and enjoying
themselves to the fullest bent of which such spirits
are capable.</p>

<p>Autumn came, cool and invigorating, and winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
with its biting winds and piercing cold followed,
making the primitive cabin in the mountain gorge
a most inviting spot in which to spend their leisure
hours. They smoked their pipes after the evening
meal, and held friendly converse as the hours wore
on, when they stretched out and slept through the
solemn stillness, broken now and then by the mournful
cry of some wild animal, until morning again
dawned.</p>

<p>Many of the excursions which they made had led
them far into the interior, and, as may be supposed,
they kept their eyes and ears open.</p>

<p>They had not only failed to meet an Indian, but
failed to catch sight of a wigwam, or the smoke of
a camp-fire other than their own; so that, as we
have repeated, they were justified, if any one could
have been, in believing that the last peril to which
they were likely to be exposed, was that from red-men.</p>

<p>And yet it was precisely that danger which was
impending over them, and which descended when
it was least expected.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Boone and Stuart start out on a Hunt&mdash;Captured by Indians and
Disarmed&mdash;Stuart's Despair and Boone's Hope&mdash;A Week's
Captivity&mdash;The Eventful Night.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the morning of December 22, 1769, Daniel
Boone and his friend John Stuart left camp, and
started out on a hunt.</p>

<p>It was the shortest day in the year, so it is to be
supposed that they were desirous of improving it
to the utmost, although they had become so accustomed
to such excursions, that there was no special
expectation excited by their venturing forth together
for a hunt through the woods.</p>

<p>Experienced as they were in woodcraft, they saw
nothing to cause the slightest misgivings. Their
keen eyes, as they roamed around the horizon, detected
no faint wreath of smoke stealing upward
through the tree-tops, telling where the camp of
the treacherous Shawanoe was kindled; the listening
ear detected no skillfully disguised bird-call
trembling on the crisp air to warn them of the wily
red-man skulking through the cane, and waiting
until they should come within reach of their bow
or rifle.</p>

<p>After leaving camp, the friends followed one of
the numerous "buffalo paths" through the cane, and
in a few minutes were out of sight of their comrades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
left behind. The air was keen and invigorating,
and they traveled carelessly along, admiring
the splendid growth of the timber and cane, showing
what an unsurpassed soil awaited the pioneers
who should settle in these valleys, and turn up the
sod for the seed of the harvest.</p>

<p>Where the game was so plentiful, there was no
likelihood of the hunters suffering from lack of
food. The buffaloes were so numerous that they
were able to approach the droves close enough to
reach them with the toss of a stone.</p>

<p>Stuart and Boone enjoyed themselves, as they
had done on many a day before, until the declining
sun warned them that it was time to turn their
faces toward camp, if they expected to spend the
night with their friends in the rude but comfortable
cabin.</p>

<p>They did so, and the sun had not yet gone down
behind the line of western forest, when they reached
a small hill near the Kentucky River, and began
leisurely moving to the top.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture, that a party of Indians
suddenly sprang up from the canebrake and rushed
upon them with such fierceness that escape was out
of the question. It was not often that Daniel
Boone was caught at disadvantage, but in this instance
he was totally outwitted, and it looked for
the moment as if he and his companion had walked
directly into a trap set for them.</p>

<p>The pioneers were too prudent to attempt anything
in the nature of resistance when the result
could but be their almost instant death, for the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
outnumbered them five to one, were fleet as
deer, and understood all the turnings and windings
of the forest. Accordingly, Boone and Stuart
quietly surrendered, hoping for the best, but expecting
the worst.</p>

<p>As might be supposed, the Indians disarmed the
hunters, and made them prisoners at once. Stuart
was terribly alarmed, for he could not see the
slightest ground for hope, but Boone, who possessed
a most equable temperament, told him to
keep up heart.</p>

<p>"As they haven't killed us," said the pioneer,
"it shows they intend to spare us for a time, at
least."</p>

<p>"Only to torture us to death hereafter," thought
his terrified companion.</p>

<p>"I don't doubt that such are their intentions,
but between now and the time, we may find our
chance. Be obedient and watchful&mdash;doing nothing
to provoke them, but be ready when the right
minute comes."</p>

<p>This was good advice, and Stuart was sensible
enough to follow it in spirit and letter.</p>

<p>It might have been expected that if a couple of
hunters intended to strike a blow for liberty, they
would do so pretty soon after their capture&mdash;that is,
as soon as the darkness of night was in their favor&mdash;but
it was only characteristic of Boone that a full
week passed before he made the first attempt to
escape.</p>

<p>During those seven days they could not fail to
catch glimpses, as it were, of freedom, and to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
tempted to make a desperate dash, for many a
time it is the very boldness of such efforts that
succeeds.</p>

<p>But Boone never lost his prudence of mind,
which enabled him to abide his time. Stuart, too,
acted as he suggested, and they very effectually
concealed their eagerness to escape.</p>

<p>However, it was not to be expected that the Indians
would be careless enough to allow them to
get away, and they maintained a most vigilant
watch upon them at all hours of the day and night.
When tramping through the wilderness or in camp,
when hunting, or sitting around the smoking logs,
the suspicious red-men were near them. When the
hour came to sleep, the prisoners were placed so as
to be surrounded, while a strong and vigilant guard
was appointed to watch over them until daylight.</p>

<p>Boone and Stuart affected quite successfully an
indifference to their situation, and, inasmuch as
they had not sought to take advantage of what
might have been intended as traps in the way of
opportunities to get away, it was only natural for
the captors to conclude that the white men
were willing to spend an indefinite time with
them.</p>

<p>What the ultimate intentions of these Indians
were, can only be conjectured, for they were a long
distance from their lodges, but those who ventured
upon hunting excursions within the Dark and
Bloody Ground were of the fiercest nature, and as
merciless as Bengal tigers, as they proved in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
a desperate encounter with the settlers; and it is
no more than reasonable to suppose that they
meant in the end to burn them at the stake, while
they danced about the scene with fiendish glee,
just as they did a few years later with Colonel
Crawford and other prisoners who fell into their
hands.</p>

<p>At last the week ended, and at the close of the
seventh day, the Indians encamped in a thick canebrake.
They had been hunting since morning,
and no opportunity presented that satisfied Boone,
but he thought the time was close at hand when
their fate was to be decided.</p>

<p>The long-continued indifference as shown by
him and his companion had produced its natural
effect upon the Indians, who showed less vigilance
than at first.</p>

<p>But they knew better than to invite anything
like that which was really contemplated, and, when
the night was advanced, the majority of the warriors
stretched out upon the ground in their blankets,
with their feet toward the fire.</p>

<p>It had been a severe day with all of them, and
the watchful Boone noticed that the guard appointed
over him and his companion were drowsy
and inattentive, while maintaining a semblance of
performing their duty.</p>

<p>"It must be done to-night," was the conclusion
of the pioneer, who was sure the signs were not
likely to be more propitious.</p>

<p>He lay down and pretended slumber, but did
not sleep a wink: his thoughts were fixed too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
intently upon the all-important step he had resolved
must be taken then or never, and he lay
thus, stretched out at full length before the hostile
camp-fire, patiently awaiting the critical moment.</p>

<p>It was near midnight when, having satisfied
himself that every warrior, including the guard,
was sound asleep, Boone cautiously raised his head
and looked towards Stuart.</p>

<p>But he was as sound asleep as the Indians themselves,
and it was a difficult and dangerous matter
to awaken him, for the Indian sleeps as lightly as
the watching lioness. The slightest incautious
movement or muttering on the part of the man
would be sure to rouse their captors.</p>

<p>But Boone managed to tell his companion
the situation, and the two with infinite care and
caution succeeded in gradually extricating themselves
from the ring of drowsy warriors.</p>

<p>"Make not the slightest noise," whispered
Boone, placing his mouth close to the ear of Stuart,
who scarcely needed the caution.</p>

<p>The camp-fire had sunk low, and the dim light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
thrown out by the smouldering logs cast grotesque
shadows of the two crouching figures as they
moved off with the noiselessness of phantoms.
Having gained such immense advantage at the
very beginning, neither was the one to throw it
away, and Stuart followed the instructions of his
companion to the letter.</p>

<p>The forms of the Indians in their picturesque
positions remained motionless, and it need hardly
be said that at the end of a few minutes, which
seemed ten times longer than they were, the two
pioneers were outside the camp, and stood together
beneath the dense shadows of the trees.</p>

<p>It was a clear, starlit night, and the hunters used
the twinkling orbs and the barks of the trees to
guide them in determining the direction of their
camp, towards which they pushed to the utmost,
for having been gone so long, they were naturally
anxious to learn how their friends had fared while
they were away.</p>

<p>Boone and Stuart scarcely halted during the
darkness, and when the sun rose, were in a portion
of the country which they easily recognized as at
no great distance from the gorge in which they had
erected their cabin more than six months before.</p>

<p>They pressed on with renewed energy, and a few
hours later reached the camp, which to their astonishment
they found deserted. The supposition
was that the hunters had grown tired or homesick
and had gone home, though there is no certainty
as to whether they were not all slain by the Indians,
who seem to have roused themselves to the danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
from the encroachments of the whites upon their
hunting-grounds.</p>

<p>It was a great disappointment to Boone and
Stuart to find themselves alone, but they determined
to stay where they were some time
longer, even though their supply of ammunition
was running low, and both were anxious to hear
from home.</p>

<p>The certainty that the Indians were in the section
about them, as the friends had learned from
dear experience, rendered it necessary to exercise
the utmost caution, for, if they should fall into
their hands again, they could not hope for such a
fortunate deliverance.</p>

<p>Instead of using the headquarters established so
long before, they moved about, selecting the most
secret places so as to avoid discovery, while they
were constantly on the alert through the day.</p>

<p>But both were masters of woodcraft, and Boone
probably had no superior in the lore of the woods.
It is said of him that, some years later, he and the
great Simon Kenton reached a river from opposite
directions at the same moment, and simultaneously
discovered, when about to cross, that a stranger was
on the other side.</p>

<p>Neither could know of a certainty whether he
confronted a friend or enemy, though the supposition
was that he was hostile, in which event the
slightest advantage gained by one was certain to
be fatal to the other.</p>

<p>Immediately the two hunters began maneuvering,
like a couple of sparrers, to discover an unguarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
point which would betray the truth.
It was early morning when this extraordinary
duel opened, and it was kept steadily up the entire
day. Just at nightfall the two intimate friends
succeeded in identifying each other.</p>

<p>A man with such Esquimau-like patience, and
such marvelous ingenuity and skill, was sure to
take the best care of himself, and during the few
days of hunting which followed, he and Stuart
kept clear of all "entangling alliances," and did
not exchange a hostile shot with the red-men.</p>

<p>In the month of January, they were hunting in
the woods, when they caught sight of two hunters
in the distance among the trees. Boone called
out:</p>

<p>"Hallo, strangers! who are you?"</p>

<p>"White men and friends," was the astonishing
answer.</p>

<p>The parties now hastened towards each other,
and what was the amazement and happiness of the
pioneers to find that one of the men was Squire
Boone, the younger brother of Daniel, accompanied
by a neighbor from his home on the far-off
Yadkin.</p>

<p>They had set out to learn the fate of the hunting
party that left North Carolina early in the
spring, and that had now been so long absent that
their friends feared the worst, and had sent the two
to learn what had become of them, just as in these
later days we send an expedition to discover the
North Pole, and then wait a little while and send
another to discover the expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
No one could have been more welcome to the two
pioneers, for they brought not only a plentiful
supply of ammunition, but, what was best of all,
full tidings of the dear ones at home.</p>

<p>Squire Boone and his companion had found the
last encampment of their friends the night before,
so they were expecting to meet them, though not
entirely relieved of their anxiety until they saw
each other.</p>

<p>It can be imagined with what delight the four
men gathered around their carefully guarded camp-fire
that evening, and talked of home and friends,
and listened to and told the news and gossip of
the neighborhood, where all their most loving associations
clustered. It must have been a late
hour when they lay down to sleep, and Daniel
Boone and Stuart that night could not fail to
dream of their friends on the banks of the distant
Yadkin.</p>

<p>The strength of the party was doubled, for there
were now four skillful hunters, and they had plenty
of ammunition, so it was decided to stay where
they were some months longer.</p>

<p>It seems strange that they should not have acted
upon the principle that in union there is strength,
for instead of hunting together, they divided in
couples. This may have offered better prospects
in the way of securing game, but it exposed them
to greater danger, and a frightful tragedy soon
resulted.</p>

<p>Boone and Stuart were hunting in company, when
they were suddenly fired into by a party of Indians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
and Stuart dropped dead. Boone was not struck,
and he dashed like a deer into the forest. Casting
one terrified glance over his shoulder, he saw
poor Stuart scalped as soon as he fell to the
earth, pierced through the heart by the fatal
bullet.</p>

<p>This left but three of them, and that fearfully
small number was soon reduced to two. The
hunter who came from North Carolina with Squire
Boone was lost in the woods, and did not return to
camp. The brothers made a long and careful
search, signaling and using every means possible to
find him, but there was no response, and despairing
and sorrowful they were obliged to give over
the hunt. He was never seen again. Years afterward
the discovery of a skeleton in the woods was
believed to indicate his fate. It is more than probable
that the stealthy shot of some treacherous
Indian, hidden in the canebrake, had closed the
career of the man as that of Stuart was ended.</p>

<p>The subsequent action of Boone was as characteristic
as it was remarkable. It is hard to
imagine a person, placed in the situation of the
two, who would not have made all haste to return
to his home; and this would be expected, especially,
of the elder brother, who had been absent
fully six months longer than the other.</p>

<p>And yet he did exactly the opposite. He had
fallen in love with the enchantments of the great
Kentucky wilderness, with its streams, rivers and
rich soil, and its boundless game, and he concluded
to stay where he was, while Squire made the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
journey back to North Carolina for more ammunition.</p>

<p>Daniel reasoned that when Squire rejoined his
family and acquainted them with his own safety,
and assured the wife and children that all was
going well with him, the great load of anxiety
would be lifted from their minds, and they would
be content to allow the two to make a still more
extended acquaintance with the peerless land beyond
the Cumberland mountains.</p>

<p>Accordingly Squire set out for his home, and it
should be borne in mind that his journey was attended
by as much danger as was the residence of
the elder brother in Kentucky, for he was in peril
from Indians all the way.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone was now left entirely alone in the
vast forests, with game, wild beasts and ferocious
Indians, while his only friend and relative was
daily increasing the distance between them, as he
journeyed toward the East.</p>

<p>Imagination must be left to picture the life of
this comparatively young man during the three
months of his brother's absence. Boone was attached
to his family, and yet he chose deliberately
to stay where he was, rather than accompany his
brother on his visit to his home.</p>

<p>But he had little time to spend in gloomy retrospection
or apprehensions, for there were plenty
of Indians in the woods, and they were continually
looking for him.</p>

<p>He changed his camp frequently, and more than
once when he lay hidden in the thick cane and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
crawled stealthily back to where he had spent the
previous night, the print of moccasins in the earth
told him how hot the hunt had been for him.</p>

<p>Indian trails were all about him, and many a
time the warriors attempted to track him through
the forest and canebrakes, but the lithe, active
pioneer was as thorough a master of woodcraft
as they, and he kept out of their way with as much
skill as Tecumseh himself ever showed in eluding
those who thirsted for his life.</p>

<p>He read the signs with the same unerring accuracy
he showed in bringing down the wild
turkey, or in barking the squirrel on the topmost
limb. Often he lay in the canebrake, and heard
the signals of the Indians as they pushed their
search for the white man who, as may be said,
dared to defy them on their own ground.</p>

<p>Boone could tell from these carefully guarded
calls how dangerous the hunt was becoming, and
when he thought the warriors were getting too close
to his hiding-place, he carefully stole out and located
somewhere else until perhaps the peril passed.</p>

<p>There must have been times when, stretched
beneath the trees and looking up at the twinkling
stars, with the murmur of the distant river or the
soughing of the night-wind through the branches,
his thoughts wandered over the hundreds of miles
of intervening wilderness to the humble home on
the bank of the Yadkin, where the loved wife and
little ones looked longingly toward the western sun
and wondered when the husband and father would
come back to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
And yet Boone has said, while admitting these
gloomy moments, when he was weighed down by
the deepest depression, that some of the most enjoyable
hours of his life were those spent in solitude,
without a human being, excepting a deadly
enemy, within hail.</p>

<p>The perils which followed every step under the
arches of the trees, but rendered them the more
attractive, and the pioneer determined to remove
his family, and to make their home in the sylvan
land of enchantment just so soon as he could complete
the necessary arrangements for doing so.</p>

<p>On the 27th of July, 1770, Squire Boone returned
and rejoined his brother, who was glad beyond description
to receive him, and to hear so directly
from his beloved home. During the absence of
the younger, the other had explored pretty much
all of the central portion of Kentucky, and the result
was that he formed a greater attachment than
ever for the new territory.</p>

<p>When Squire came back, Daniel said that he
deemed it imprudent to stay where they were any
longer. The Indians were so numerous and vigilant
that it seemed impossible to keep out of their
way; accordingly they proceeded to the Cumberland
River, where they spent the time in hunting
and exploration until the early spring of 1771.</p>

<p>They gave names to numerous streams, and,
having enjoyed a most extraordinary hunting jaunt,
were now ready to go back to North Carolina and
rejoin their families.</p>

<p>But they set out for their homes with not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
slightest purpose of staying there. They had seen
too much of the pleasures of the wood, for either to
be willing to give them up. In North Carolina
there was the most exasperating trouble. The
tax-gatherer was omnipresent and unbearably oppressive;
the social lines between the different
classes was drawn as if with a two-edged sword;
there were murmurs and mutterings of anger in
every quarter; Governor Tryon, instead of pacifying,
was only fanning the flames; ominous signs
were in the skies, and anarchy, red war and appalling
disaster seemed to loom up in the near
future.</p>

<p>What wonder, therefore, that Daniel Boone
turned his eyes with a longing such as comes over
the weary traveler who, after climbing a precipitous
mountain, looks beyond and sees the
smiling verdure of the promised land.</p>

<p>He had determined to emigrate long before, and
he now made what might be called the first move
in that direction. He and his brother pushed
steadily forward without any incident worth noting,
and reached their homes in North Carolina, where,
as may well be supposed, they were welcomed like
those who had risen from the dead. They had
been gone many months, and in the case of Daniel,
two years had passed since he clasped his loved
wife and children in his arms.</p>

<p>The neighbors, too, had feared the worst, despite
the return of Squire Boone with the good news of
the pioneer, and they were entertained as were
those at court when Columbus, coming back from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
his first voyage across the unknown seas, related
his marvelous stories of the new world beyond.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone found his family well, and, as his
mind was fixed upon his future course, he began
his preparations for removal to Kentucky.</p>

<p>This was a most important matter, for there was
a great deal to do before the removal could be
effected. It was necessary to dispose of the little
place upon which they had lived so long and bestowed
so much labor, and his wife could not be
expected to feel enthusiastic over the prospect of
burying herself in the wilderness, beyond all
thought of returning to her native State.</p>

<p>Then again Boone was not the one to entertain
such a rash scheme as that of removing to Kentucky,
without taking with him a strong company,
able to hold its own against the Indians, who were
certain to dispute their progress.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand the work which lay
before Boone, and it may be well believed that
months passed without any start being made,
though the great pioneer never faltered or wavered
in his purpose.</p>

<p>Matters were not improving about him. The
trouble, distress, and difficulties between the
authorities and the people were continually aggravated,
and the Revolution was close at hand.</p>

<p>At the end of two years, however, Boone was
prepared to make the momentous move, and it was
done. The farm on the Yadkin was sold, and he had
gathered together a goodly company for the purpose
of forming the first real settlement in Kentucky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
During the few years immediately preceding, the
territory was visited by other hunters, while Boone
himself was alone in the solitude. A company
numbering forty, and led by Colonel James Knox,
gathered for a grand buffalo hunt in the valleys of
the Clinch, New River, and Holston. A number
of them skirted along the borders of Tennessee and
Kentucky.</p>

<p>While they were thus engaged, others penetrated
the valleys from Virginia and Pennsylvania, and
among them was a young man named George
Washington.</p>

<p>As is well known, his attention had been
directed some time before to the lands along the
Ohio, and he owned a number of large claims. He
clearly foresaw the teeming future of the vast West,
and he was especially desirous of informing himself
concerning the lands lying in the neighborhood of
the mouth of the Kanawha.</p>

<p>At that particular date, the Virginians were converging
toward the country south of the river, and
there were many difficulties with the Indians, who
then as now are ready to resist entrance upon their
hunting-grounds, even though the immigrants are
backed by the stipulations of a recently signed
treaty.</p>

<p>On the 25th of September, 1774, Daniel Boone
and his family started to make their settlement in
Kentucky.</p>

<p>He had as his company his brother Squire, who
had spent several months with him in the wilderness,
and they took with them quite a number of
cattle and swine with which to stock their farms
when they should reach their destination, while
their luggage was carried on pack-horses.</p>

<p>At Powell's Valley, not very far distant, they
were joined by another party, numbering five families
and forty able-bodied men, all armed and provided
with plenty of ammunition. This made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
force a formidable one, and they pushed on in
high spirits.</p>

<p>When night came they improvised tents with
poles and their blankets, and the abundance of game
around them removed all danger of suffering from the
lack of food, for it was but sport to bring down
enough of it to keep the entire company well supplied.</p>

<p>The experience of the Boones, when they passed
through this region previously, taught them to
be on their guard constantly, for the most likely
time for the Indians to come is when they are least
expected, and the leaders saw to it that no precaution
was neglected.</p>

<p>And yet it is easy to see that such a large company,
moving slowly, and encumbered by women
and children and so much luggage and live-stock,
was peculiarly exposed to danger from the dreaded
Indians.</p>

<p>On the 10th of October they approached Cumberland
Gap. The cattle had fallen to the rear,
where they were plodding leisurely along, with
several miles separating them from their friends in
front, when the latter suddenly heard the reports
of guns coming to them through the woods. They
instantly paused and, looking in each other's pale
faces, listened.</p>

<p>There could be no mistaking their meaning, for
the reports were from the direction of the cattle in
the rear, and the shouts and whoops came from
the brazen throats of Indians, who had attacked
the weak guard of the live-stock.</p>

<p>Boone and his friends, leaving a sufficient guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
for the women and children, hurried back to the
assistance of the young men, who were in such
imminent peril.</p>

<p>There was sore need of their help indeed, for the
attack, like the generality of those made by Indians,
was sudden, unexpected, and of deadly
fierceness. When the panting hunters reached
the spot, they found the cattle had been stampeded
and scattered irrecoverably in the woods, while of
the seven men who had the kine in charge, only
one escaped alive, and he was badly wounded.</p>

<p>Among the six who lay stretched in death, was
the oldest son of Daniel Boone, slain, as may be
said, just as he was about entering upon the promised
land.</p>

<p>The disaster was an appalling one, and it spread
gloom and sorrow among the emigrants, who
might well ask themselves whether, if they were
forced to run the gauntlet in that fearful fashion,
they would be able to hold their own if spared to
reach Kentucky?</p>

<p>A council was called, and the question was discussed
most seriously. Daniel Boone, who had
suffered such an affliction in the loss of his child,
strenuously favored pushing on, as did his brother
and a number of the other emigrants, but the majority
were disheartened by the disaster, and insisted
on going back to their homes, where, though
the annoyances might be many, no such calamity
was to be dreaded.</p>

<p>The sentiment for return was so strong that the
Boones were compelled to yield, and turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
about, they made their way slowly and sadly to
Clinch River settlement, in the southwestern part
of Virginia, a distance of perhaps forty miles from
where they were attacked by Indians.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to look upon this occurrence
in any other light than a most serious check and
misfortune, as certainly was the case, so far as the
loss of the half dozen men was concerned, but the
turning back of the rest of the party was unquestionably
a providential thing.</p>

<p>It was a short time previous to this, that the
historical Logan episode took place. The family
of that noted chief and orator were massacred, and
the fierce Dunmore War was the consequence.
This was impending at the very time Boone and
the others were journeying toward Kentucky, and
breaking out shortly afterwards, extended to the
very section in which the emigrants expected to
settle, and where in all probability they would
have suffered much more severely had they not
turned back for the time.</p>

<p>Nothing could change the purpose of Boone to
enter into Kentucky, and to make his home there.
Although obliged from the sentiment of his friends
to withdraw for a time, he looked upon the check
as only a temporary one, and was confident that
before long he would be firmly fixed in what he
called the "land of promise."</p>

<p>Boone was not to be an idle spectator of the
famous Dunmore War going on around him. In
the month of June, 1774, he and Michael Stoner
were requested by Governor Dunmore of Virginia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
to go to the falls of the Ohio, for the purpose of
guiding into the settlement a party of surveyors,
sent out some months before.</p>

<p>Boone and his friend promptly complied, and
conducted the surveyors through the difficult and
dangerous section without accident, completing a
tour of eight hundred miles in a couple of months.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward Boone rejoined his family on
Clinch river, and was there when Governor Dunmore
sent him a commission as captain, and
ordered him to take command of three contiguous
garrisons on the frontier, during the prosecution
of the war against the Indians.</p>

<p>Boone, who had proven his coolness and intrepidity
many a time, was equally prompt in discharging
the responsible duty with which the
governor honored him. It is believed that the
pioneer was present at the famous battle of Point
Pleasant, which perhaps was the most furious contest
ever waged with the Indians on Virginia soil.</p>

<p>The Shawanoes, Delawares, Mingoes, Wyandots
and Cayugas, to the number of 1500, and under
the leadership of such famous chiefs as Logan,
Cornstock, Elenipsico, Red-Eagle and others, made
a fight against General Lewis and his brave Virginians,
not only with bravery, but with a skill
which came within a hair's-breadth of annihilating
the entire force of whites as utterly as was that
of General Custer more than a century later.</p>

<p>Finally, however, the sanguinary fight terminated
in favor of the Virginians, by a skillful maneuvre
at the proper moment, and the savages were completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
routed. Not long afterward a treaty of peace
was made in which the Indians surrendered all
claim to Kentucky. As the Six Nations had done
the same six years before, it may be said that all
the aboriginal title to Kentucky was extinguished
when Boone settled there.</p>

<p>Dunmore's War having terminated with the utter
overthrow of the combined tribes, the militia that
had been called into service were discharged, and
Boone returned to his family on Clinch River.</p>

<p>He had already become known as a hunter and
explorer possessing great daring and shrewdness,
and those were the days when such men were
needed in wresting the Western wilderness from
the grasp of the wild Indian, who was sure to
fight the advancing hosts of civilization with the
treacherous fierceness which the barbarian always
displays in defending its young.</p>

<p>Boone, therefore, had been home but a short
time, when he received a request from a company
of North Carolinians, who proposed purchasing a
large tract of land lying to the south of Kentucky
River from the Cherokee Indians, to attend their
treaty to be held at Wataga in March, 1775, with
a view of negotiating with them, and determining
the boundaries of the purchase.</p>

<p>This association was known as Colonel Richard
Henderson's Company, and it was one of the most
extraordinary that was engaged at any time in
opening up our Western territory.</p>

<p>When the Boones returned from their first visit
to Kentucky, it is scarcely necessary to say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
they gave glowing descriptions of its wonderful attractiveness
for the hunter and settler. These
accounts spread over North Carolina and created
great excitement, one of the direct results being
the formation of Colonel Henderson's Company.
The originator was a man of education, wealth
and energy, and he displayed such ability and
daring in its management, that he frightened off
most of his rivals, or led them to enlist under his
banner.</p>

<p>At that time the entire country lying within the
natural lines formed by the Ohio, Kentucky and
Cumberland rivers was claimed by the Cherokee
Indians, who lived within the boundaries of North
Carolina. Previously, however, Virginia had given
an impetus to the exploration and adventure in
Kentucky, by presenting to her officers and soldiers
Western lands by way of bounties for their
services in the British army, in the old war between
France and England. It was required that
these lands should be surveyed by the claimants,
who were also given a large discretion in locating
their claims.</p>

<p>The first of these was made upon the Kanawha
in the year 1772, and the second was on the south
side of the Ohio the following year.</p>

<p>The business having begun it was pressed vigorously
forward. Extensive tracts were surveyed on
the north fork of the Licking and numerous salt licks,
and other especially desirable spots were
taken up.</p>

<p>The year 1774 was notable for arrivals in Kentucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
of those who were entitled to lands, besides
scores of others who went to indulge in speculation,
and to secure the most valuable sections before
they could be taken by others.</p>

<p>Among those daring explorers and hunters was
James Harrod, at the head of a party of Kentuckians
from the shores of the Monongahela.
They followed the Kentucky River into the interior,
and left it at a place afterwards known as
"Harrod's Landing." Moving further westward
they located themselves in a beautiful and attractive
section, where they erected the first log-cabin
ever built in Kentucky.</p>

<p>This was near the present town of Harrodsburg,
in the spring of 1774, and this place, therefore,
may claim to be the oldest settlement in Kentucky.
Harrodsburg is now the capital of Mercer
county, and is thirty miles south of Frankfort, with
a population of about 2,500. It is an attractive
summer retreat, and enjoys a fine reputation for its
mineral waters.</p>

<p>As we have stated, the most remarkable of the
many associations formed for the settlement of
Kentucky was that organized by Colonel Richard
Henderson of North Carolina.</p>

<p>It was intended to obtain by purchase from the
Cherokee Indians their right to the same, and then
to take possession of the immense area. As soon
as the organization of the company was effected,
Daniel Boone was fixed upon to conduct the negotiations
with the Cherokees. As might have been
anticipated, he met with perfect success, and Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Henderson went to Wataga, a small place on
the Holston River, where, in solemn council, on
the 17th of March, 1775, he delivered to them a
consideration in merchandise, for which he received
in return a deed to Kentucky, signed by all the
leading chiefs.</p>

<p>This was a most important step indeed, but another
of no less importance remained to be taken,
and that was to assume possession of the territory
claimed by Colonel Henderson.</p>

<p>This gentleman was too energetic and clear-sighted
to delay such a necessary measure, and his
wisdom was further shown by fixing upon Captain
Daniel Boone for the carrying out of his intentions.</p>

<p>A small company of brave and trustworthy men
were at once selected, who were sent to Kentucky
under the direction of Boone, with instructions to
open a road from the Holston to the Kentucky
River, and to erect a station at the mouth of Otter
Creek, on the latter stream.</p>

<p>This was serious business, and none appreciated
it more than Boone and his companions, who knew
that the treaty signed with the chiefs would not
afford them the slightest protection against the
treacherous Indians. They proceeded with the
greatest care and caution, keeping their most vigilant
sentinels on the lookout at night, while every
man, it may be said, was on guard through the
day.</p>

<p>They pushed steadily forward, until they reached
a point about fifteen miles from where Boonesborough
stands, using all the dispatch possible, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
escaping molestation up to that time. But at the
place named, they were suddenly fired upon by
Indians, who, springing up from their ambush,
attacked them with great ferocity. Two of the
whites were killed and two wounded, but they
repulsed their assailants a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Boone and his friends lost no time in pressing
ahead; but three days later, they were fired upon
by Indians again, and two of their number were
killed and three wounded. Well might Kentucky
be named the Dark and Bloody Ground, for its soil
has been crimsoned with the life-current of its earliest
pioneers, from the very hour they first placed
foot within its borders.</p>

<p>The settlers, however, had no thought of turning
back, but fought their way, as may be said, to the
Kentucky River, which they reached on the 1st of
April, 1775, and began the erection of the fort of
Boonesborough at a salt lick, about two hundred
feet from the south bank of the river.</p>

<p>A few days later, the Indians shot one of the
men, but the others paused in their work only long
enough to give their late comrade a respectful
burial, and to shed a few tears of sympathy over
his loss, when they resumed cutting and hewing
the logs and placing them in position.</p>

<p>They continued steadily at work, and the fort
was finished by the middle of June following, when,
having satisfactorily discharged his duty, Boone
returned to his family at the Clinch River settlement.</p>

<p>Kentucky was formally taken possession of on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
the 20th of April, 1775, which, it may be stated,
was on the very day that Colonel Richard Henderson
reached the age of forty years, there being
about two months difference between his age and
that of Daniel Boone.</p>

<p>Henderson was a native Virginian, who had been
a judge in the Superior Court of the Colonial Government
of North Carolina; but the halls of justice
were shut up by the anarchy occasioned by the
Regulators, and he engaged a number of the most
influential of North Carolinians in the Utopian
scheme of founding the Republic of Transylvania.
It was with this grandiloquent project in their
mind, that Kentucky was taken possession of on
the date named, and everything considered necessary
was done for laying the foundation stones of
the model republic in the heart of American territory.</p>

<p>The death-blow of the grand scheme was received
before it was fairly born. Governor Martin of
North Carolina issued a proclamation, declaring the
purchase of the lands by Colonel Henderson and
his association from the Cherokees illegal; but, as a
matter of equity, the State subsequently granted
200,000 acres to the company.</p>

<p>Virginia did the same thing, granting them an
equal number of acres bounded by the Ohio and
Green Rivers. Tennessee claimed this tract, but
gave in compensation therefor the same number of
acres in Powell's Valley. Thus ended the attempt
to found the Transylvania Republic, but the original
projectors of the movement acquired individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
fortunes, and Colonel Henderson himself,
when he died, ten years later, was the possessor of
immense wealth, and was loved and respected
throughout the entire territory.</p>

<p>The old fort at Boonesborough, being the first
real foothold gained by the pioneers, was sure to
become most prominently identified with the Indian
troubles that were inevitable. It was to be a
haven of safety to many a settler and his family,
when the whoop of the vengeful Shawanoe or
Miami rang through the forest arches, and the sharp
crack of the warrior's rifle sent the whizzing bullet
to the heart of the white man who had ventured
and trusted his all in the wilderness.</p>

<p>It was to be the lighthouse on the coast of
danger, warning of the peril that lay around and
beyond, but offering protection to those who fled
to its rude shelter, as the cities of the olden times
received and spread their arms over the panting
fugitive escaping from his pursuers.</p>

<p>The old fort was a most notable figure in the
history of the West, a hundred years ago. There
have been gathered in the structure of logs and
slabs, the bravest men who ever trailed the red
Indian through the wilderness. There those
mighty giants of the border, Boone, Kenton, Wells,
M'Clelland, the Wetzel and McAfee Brothers,
M'Arthur, and scores of others converged from
their long journeyings in the service of the Government;
and, closing about the fire, as they smoked
their pipes, they told of the hand-to-hand encounter
in the silent depths of the woods, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
maneuvering on the banks of the lonely mountain
stream, of the panther-like creeping through the
canebrake on the trail of the Indian, of the camps
at night, when the Shawanoes were so plentiful that
they did not dare close their eyes through fear that
their breathing would betray them, of the smoking
cabin with the mutilated forms of husband, wife,
and babe showing that the aboriginal tigers had been
there, of the death-shots, the races for life, and the
days of perils which followed the daring scout up
to the very stockades of Boonesborough.</p>

<p>Sometimes one of the rangers of the wilderness
would fail to come into the fort when expected.
There would be mutual inquiries on the part of
those who had been accustomed to meet him.
Perhaps some one would say he was scouting for
the Government, but nothing would be known with
certainty, and a suspicion would begin to shape
itself that he had "lain down," never to rise again.</p>

<p>Perhaps some ranger in threading his way
through the long leagues of trackless forests would
stop to camp from the snow which was whirling
and eddying about him, while the wintry wind
moaned and soughed through the swaying
branches overhead; and mayhap, as he cautiously
struck flint and steel in the hidden gorge, he saw
dimly outlined in the gathering gloom the form of
a man, shrunk to that of a skeleton, in which the
spark of life had been extinguished long before.</p>

<p>The bullet-hole in the chest, or the cleft made
in the skull by the fiercely-driven tomahawk,
showed why it was the scout had been missing so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
long, and why his cheery voice and ringing laugh
would never be heard again.</p>

<p>Boonesborough, as we have stated, stood about
200 feet from the Kentucky River, one of its angles
resting on its banks near the water, and extending
from it in the form of a parallelogram. The length
of the fort, allowing twenty feet for each cabin and
opening, was 260 with a breadth of 150 feet. The
houses were built of rough logs, and were bulletproof.
They were square in form, one of the cabins
projecting from each corner, the remaining spaces
along the sides being filled with cabins, constructed
more with an eye to strength than beauty.</p>

<p>On the side facing the river was a large strong
gate moving on wooden hinges, and a similar one
was placed on the opposite side.</p>

<p>The cabins along the four sides were connected
by pickets, which consisted of slabs, sharpened at
one end and driven deep into the ground. Such
forts would be of little account in these days,
but they were effective against the Indians who
followed such desultory warfare, and who were
thus compelled, as may be said, to transfer the advantage
which they naturally sought to their
enemies.</p>

<p>A frontier fort like Boonesborough did not afford
that absolute protection which would allow the
garrison to lie down and slumber in peace, certain
that all danger was removed. The Indian was
wily and catlike by nature; he knew the advantage
of mining, and took naturally to the most insidious
methods of warfare; but the whites, if vigilant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
were sure to detect such demonstrations, and
they possessed the power to countermine, and
defeat any and every movement of the savages.
Besides this, and above all, the garrison possessed
a shelter from which to aim their deadly rifles, and
they might well scorn the attempt of any force of
warriors that could be gathered together.</p>

<p>The fort with its cabins was completed in the
early summer of 1774, including also the cabins
and buildings intended for the friends and families
who were expected to join them a few months
later. Colonel Henderson and a couple of the proprietors
visited the place, and gave it its name in
honor of the great pioneer who had built it.</p>

<p>These leaders took with them some forty new settlers,
a large number of pack-horses, and a goodly
supply of such articles as were needed at a frontier-post
like Boonesborough. And now it will be admitted
that Boone and his employers were fully
warranted in believing that at last a permanent
settlement had been planted on Kentucky soil.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Boone Rejoins his Family at the Clinch River Settlement&mdash;Leads
a Company of Immigrants into Kentucky&mdash;Insecurity
of Settlers&mdash;Dawn of the American Revolution&mdash;British
Agents Incite the Indians to Revolt against the Settlements.</p></blockquote>

<p>Daniel Boone showed his faith in the success
of the enterprise, by announcing his intention of
bringing his family into Kentucky to stay as long
as they lived.</p>

<p>Accordingly he proceeded to the Clinch River
settlement, where he gave more glowing accounts
than ever of the beauties and attraction of the new
country.</p>

<p>The result was inevitable. The stories of foreign
lands never lose any of their brilliant coloring
when they come from the mouth of one who has
passed through the enchanting experiences of
which he tells us.</p>

<p>What though he speaks of the deadly peril
which lingers around the footsteps of the explorer,
is it not one of the laws of this strange nature of
ours that the attraction is thereby rendered the
greater? is it not a sad fact that the forbidden
pleasure is the one that tastes the sweeter?</p>

<p>Boone set his neighbors to talking, and by the
time his family was ready to move to Kentucky, a
number were fully as eager as he to go to the new
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
The pioneer was chosen to lead them. They
turned their backs forever upon North Carolina in
the autumn of 1775, and facing westward, set out
for their destination.</p>

<p>When they reached Powell's valley, several other
families were awaiting them, and, thus re-enforced,
the company numbered twenty-six men, four women,
five boys and girls&mdash;quite a formidable force,
when it is remembered they were under the leadership
of Daniel Boone, to whom the trail had become
so familiar during the preceding years.</p>

<p>This little calvacade wound its way through
Cumberland Gap, all in high spirits, though sensible
of the dangers which, it may be said, hovered
about them from the very hour they left Clinch
River.</p>

<p>Good fortune attended the venture, and for the
first time of which we have record, the entire
journey was made without the loss of any of their
number at the hands of the Indians.</p>

<p>Never forgetting that the utmost vigilance was
necessary to insure this exemption, if such insurance
be considered possible, Boone permitted
nothing like negligence, either when on the march
or in camp.</p>

<p>But, in recalling those first expeditions to the
West, one cannot help wondering at their success.
Had the Indians shown a realizing sense of the
strength in union, which they displayed at the
battle of Point Pleasant, the Thames, and in the
defeats of St. Clair, Crawford and others, they
could have crushed out these attempts at settlement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
and postponed the opening up of the country
for many years. What more easy than to have
concentrated several hundred of their warriors,
and, waiting until the little companies of settlers
had penetrated too far into their territory to withdraw,
led them into ambush and annihilated every
man, woman and child?</p>

<p>But they chose, when not engaged in their rare
movements on a large scale, to fight in a desultory
fashion, firing from behind the tree or from the
covert, or watching for the unsuspecting settler
to appear at the door of his cabin.</p>

<p>This manner of fighting made the feeling of uncertainty
general, for no man could know when
the peril threatened his wife and little ones, nor
when the spiteful attack would be made by some
small band of warriors, venturing from the main
body and relying upon their own celerity of movement
to escape before the settlers could rally in
time to strike back.</p>

<p>This species of warfare, we say, was extremely
perilous to the settlers and pioneers, but it could
never become an effective check to the advancing
hosts of civilization, which were beginning to converge
from a dozen different directions upon the
fair forests and fertile plains of Kentucky.</p>

<p>When Boone and his party reached the headwaters
of Dick's River, a halt was made, and a division
took place. Several of the families preferred
to settle at Harrodsburg&mdash;the cabin of Harrod having
been erected there the year previous. With
mutual good wishes, therefore, they separated from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
the main company, and pushing resolutely forward,
reached their destination in safety.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, there was but the one
haven which loomed up invitingly before Daniel
Boone,&mdash;that was the station named after himself,
and which was now at no great distance away. He
and the main body reached it without molestation,
and they helped to swell the numbers that were
already making Boonesborough the strongest post
in the West.</p>

<p>It is one of the facts of which the pioneer was
proud throughout his long, eventful life, that his
wife and daughter were the first white women who
ever "stood upon the banks of the wild and beautiful
Kentucky."</p>

<p>But, as we have stated, settlers, speculators, surveyors,
and adventurers were converging to the
Dark and Bloody Ground, which was receiving an influx
almost daily&mdash;the most of the new-comers being
of a character desirable and useful to a new country.</p>

<p>The latter part of 1775 was specially noteworthy
for the number of settlers who entered Kentucky.
The majority of these made their rendezvous at
Boonesborough, which soon became what might be
called the headquarters of the pioneers. Many
attached themselves to Boone's colony, others went
to Harrodsburg, while some, having completed
the survey of their lands, returned home.</p>

<p>It was during these stirring days that Boone
received visits from Kenton, the McAfees and other
men, who became so noted afterward as scouts and
border rangers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Those were momentous times in the Colonies,
for, as the reader will observe, our forefathers were
on the very verge of the American Revolution.
The country was trembling with excitement from
one end to the other. In the spring of the year
occurred the battle of Lexington, when was fired
the shot that was "heard around the world," and
the war opened between Great Britain and the
Colonies. Men left the plow in the furrow, the
shop and their homes, and hastened to arms, while
Boone and his brother colonists were planting their
homes hundreds of miles beyond the frontiers of
the Carolinas. Many believed the treaties previously
made with the Indians would protect them
from molestation at their hands, but in this expectation
the pioneers were wofully disappointed.</p>

<p>It was necessary for the mother country to put
forth the most gigantic efforts to subdue her
American colonies, or she would be confronted
with rebellions among her colonial possessions all
around the globe.</p>

<p>Despite the treaties with the aborigines, English
emissaries were soon at work, inciting the Indians
to revolt against the intruders upon their soil.
There is good reason to believe that more than this
was done, and Great Britain furnished the tribes
with guns and ammunition, with which to give
practical expression to their enmity toward the
white settlers in Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>

<p>The American Indian, as a rule, does not require
much persuasion to begin the work of rapine and
massacre, as we have found from dealing with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
ourselves. When they have received their supplies
from our Government agents, and have had their
usual "palaver" with the peace agents, they are
fully prepared to enter upon the war-path.</p>

<p>The student of Western history will recognize
the date named as the beginning of the most
troublous times on the Kentucky frontier. The
settlers had planted themselves on the soil with
the purpose of remaining, and they were prepared
to defend their homes against all comers. But the
most resolute bravery and consummate woodcraft
cannot give absolute protection from such a foe as
the original American.</p>

<p>The sturdy settler who plunged into the woods,
with his glittering axe in hand, was not secure
against the shot from behind the tree which bordered
his path, and the plowman who slowly
guided his team to the opposite end of the clearing,
could have no guarantee that one of the painted
warriors had not been crouching there for hours,
waiting with his serpent-like eyes fixed upon him,
until he should reach the spot in order to send a
bullet through his heart; the mother, busy with
her household duties, was not sure that the leaden
messenger would not be aimed, with unerring skill,
the moment she showed herself at the door, nor
could she be assured that when her little ones ventured
from her sight, they would not be caught up
and spirited away, or that the tomahawk would
not be sent crashing into their brain.</p>

<p>The sounds of what seemed the hooting of owls
in the dead of night were the signals which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Indians were exchanging as they crept like panthers
from different directions upon the doomed
cabin; the faint caw of crows, apparently from the
tops of the trees, were the signals of the vengeful
warriors, as they approached the house which they
had fixed upon as the one that should be burned
and its inmates massacred.</p>

<p>There was the fort known as Harrod's Old Cabin
and Boonesborough, while other rude structures
were reared in the clearings with the intention of
being used as a protection against the red-men.
These served their good purpose, and many a time
saved the settlers from the peril which stole upon
them like the insidious advance of the pestilence
that smites at noonday,&mdash;but they could give no
security to the lonely cabins with the stretches of
forest between and the faint trail connecting them
with the fort.</p>

<p>When the Shawanoes and Miamis came, it was
like the whirlwind, and many a time they delivered
their frightful blows, withdrew, and were miles
away in the recesses of the woods, where pursuit
was impossible, before the garrison at the station
could answer the call for help.</p>

<p>But, as we have said, these frightful atrocities
and dangers could not turn back the tide of emigration
that was pouring westward. The trail which
Boone had marked from Holston to Boonesborough
was distinct enough for the passage of pack-horses,
and the long files which plodded over the perilous
path always had their heads turned to the westward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
The flat-boats that swung slowly with the current
down the Ohio were pierced with bullets from
the shores, and, in some instances, nearly all the
occupants were picked off by the Indian marksmen;
but had it been in the power of these cumbrous
craft to turn back, they would not have
done so.</p>

<p>The American pioneer is daunted by no danger,
baffled by no difficulty, and discouraged by no
adversity. The time had come for opening up the
western wilds, and nothing but the hand of Providence
himself could stop or delay the work.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Comparative Quiet on the Frontier&mdash;Capture of Boone's
Daughter and the Misses Callaway by Indians&mdash;Pursued
by Boone and Seven Companions&mdash;Their Rescue and Return
to their Homes.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was the summer of 1776, and the colonies
were aflame with war. Those were the days
which tried men's souls, and the skies were dark
with discouragement and coming disaster. There
were many hearts that could only see overwhelming
failure in the momentous struggle in which the
country was engaged.</p>

<p>For a time, comparative quiet reigned in the
neighborhood of Boonesborough. The settlers
improved the time to the utmost. While some
hunted and fished, others cleared the land, and a
promising crop of corn had been put in the rich
soil. Only one of the colony had been shot by
Indians during the preceding winter, the band which
did it having withdrawn before any retaliatory
measures could be taken.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the seventh of July, Miss
Betsey Callaway, her sister Frances, and a daughter
of Daniel Boone entered a canoe under the bank
of the river, as children would naturally do to
amuse themselves. Betsey was a young lady, but
the other two were about thirteen years of age,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>all
bright, joyous girls, who had no thought of
danger, as they paddled about the rock where the
frail boat had been moored.</p>

<p>They were laughing and paddling, when suddenly
a rustling among the overhanging bushes
arrested their attention, and, turning their gaze,
they saw with consternation the painted face of an
Indian warrior.</p>

<p>The girls were almost paralyzed with terror.
The savage warned them by signs to make no outcry,
through penalty of being brained with the
tomahawk griped in his hand. They could only
huddle together in terror and await his pleasure,
whatever it might be.</p>

<p>The sinewy Indian then stepped cautiously into
the canoe, and took up the paddle, which he handled
with the skill peculiar to his people. With
scarcely the slightest plash, he silently forced it
out from the undergrowth and started for the other
shore.</p>

<p>The terrified girls looked appealingly in the
direction of the stockades, but they dare make no
outcry. The stalwart savage dipped the paddle
first on one side and then on the other, and the
canoe rapidly neared the shore, beneath whose
overhanging bushes it glided the next moment like
an arrow.</p>

<p>Turning toward the girls, the Indian signified
that they were to leave the boat, and the poor
girls could do nothing less. Several other warriors
who were in waiting, joined them, and the journey
was instantly begun toward the interior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
No more unfavorable time for the captives could
have been selected. It was late in the afternoon,
and before anything like pursuit could be organized
it would be night, and the trail invisible.
The Indians would use all the woodcraft at their
command, and doubtless the morning would see
them many miles removed from the settlement.</p>

<p>The captors took the very precautions of which
we have spoken, directing their steps toward the
thickest cane, where they separated and made their
way through it with the utmost caution, with a
view of rendering their footprints so faint that pursuit
would be out of the question.</p>

<p>Having assured themselves, so far as they could,
that their trail was hidden from the scrutiny of
the settlers, the Indians with the three girls made
another turn, and striking a buffalo path, pushed
forward without delay.</p>

<p>The girls had been reared in a society where outdoor
life and exercise were a part of their creed,
and they stood the unwonted task forced upon
them with much greater fortitude than would have
been supposed. They walked nimbly along, taking
great consolation in each other's company,
though they were almost heartbroken at the thought
that every mile through the gloomy forest was
taking them so much further away from their
loved ones, and lessened in the same degree their
chances of rescue by their friends at Boonesborough.</p>

<p>It being midsummer, they did not suffer from
cold, and but for their terror of their ultimate fate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
they would have cared nothing for the jaunt. Still,
as children will feel under such circumstances, they
had strong hopes that their parents and friends
would soon be in close pursuit of the Indians.</p>

<p>And such indeed was the case. For it was not
long before the girls were missed at Boonesborough,
and search made for them. Some one had seen
them in the canoe, and when it was discovered that
the boat was left on the opposite side of the river,
and when the keen eyes of the pioneers were able
to detect the imprint of moccasins along the shore
where the craft had been moored on their side,
there could be no doubt of what it meant.</p>

<p>The girls had been captured and carried away by
Indians.</p>

<p>It can be well understood that great excitement
spread among the families of Boonesborough, all of
whom were drawn together by the closest ties of
friendship, and who shared in each other's joys and
woes. The whole male force were ready to start
at a moment's notice to the rescue.</p>

<p>But that was not the way in which to secure
them, for it would have been equally effective for
a hunting party to go in search of the timid antelope
with drums and banners. What was needed
was a small company of hunters, brave, swift of foot,
clear-headed and skilled in the ways of the woods.</p>

<p>They should be men who could trail the red
Indian where the imprints of his moccasined feet
were invisible to ordinary eyes, and who, when the
critical emergency should come, were sure to do
just the right thing at the right time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
There were plenty such in Boonesborough,
and there could be no difficulty in finding them.
At the head, of course, stood Daniel Boone himself,
and he selected seven others who could be
relied on in any emergency; but, by the time the
pursuit could be begun, the shades of night were
settling over wood and river, and it was out of the
question to attempt anything like an intelligent
search for the girls.</p>

<p>In such a case there is no basis for reasoning, for
though it may seem certain to the veteran hunter
that his enemy has taken a certain course in order
to reach his distant lodge, yet the morning is likely
to show that he has gone on a different route altogether.</p>

<p>The American Indian, who is educated from his
infancy in cunning and treachery, is likely to do
that which is least expected and provided against;
and Boone, therefore, did not make the mistake of
acting upon any theory of his own which was likely
to cause him to lose many precious hours of pursuit.</p>

<p>But it was the season when the days were
longest, and at the earliest streakings of the morning
light, the eight pioneers were on the other side
of the river, looking for the trail of the Indians.</p>

<p>The delicate imprints were discovered almost
instantly by the keen-eyed hunters, who started on
the scent like bloodhounds, eager to spring at the
throats of the savages.</p>

<p>But the pursuit was scarcely begun, when they
were confronted by the very difficulty which they
anticipated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
The Indians, as we have shown, had separated
and made their way through the thickest cane with
such extreme care, that they succeeded in hiding
their trail from the lynx eyes of even Boone himself.</p>

<p>In such an emergency, the pursuers could only
fall back on their own resources of calculation and
observation.</p>

<p>They noticed that the tracks all pointed in one
general direction, and there was, therefore, a basis
for deciding the side of the cane where they
emerged. Acting upon this theory, they made a
circuitous journey of fully thirty miles, and sure
enough, struck the trail just as they hoped rather
than expected.</p>

<p>Boone showed his woodcraft now by forming a
reasonable theory and acting promptly upon it,
for, though he may have been right, still he would
have lost all the advantage by a failure to follow
it up instantly.</p>

<p>Recalling the unusual precautions taken by the
Indians to throw their pursuers off their trail,
Boone was convinced that the savages would
believe that these precautions had accomplished
their purpose, and they would therefore relax their
vigilance. Their course, as a consequence, would
be followed more easily.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Boone and his comrades changed
the route they were following, with the idea of
crossing the path of the Indians. They had not
gone far when they discovered it in a buffalo path,
where it was quite evident that, from the careless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
manner in which the red-men were traveling, they
had no suspicion of their pursuers being anywhere
in the vicinity.</p>

<p>This was favorable to Boone and his companions,
but they understood the delicacy and danger of the
situation, which was of that character that they
might well tremble for its success, even with the
great advantage gained.</p>

<p>None knew better than they the sanguinary
character of the American Indian. The very moment
the captors should see that it was impossible
to retain the prisoners, they would sink their tomahawks
in their brains, even though the act increased
their own personal peril tenfold.</p>

<p>It was all-important that the pursuit should be
vigorously pressed, and at the same time it was
equally important that the savages should be kept
in ignorance of the men who were trailing them
so closely.</p>

<p>As silently, therefore, as shadows, the pioneers,
with their guns at a trail, threaded their way
through the forest and dense canebrakes. Their
keen and trained vision told them they were gaining
rapidly upon the Indians, who were proceeding
at that leisurely gait which was proof that they
held no suspicion of danger.</p>

<p>The settlers had already traveled a long distance,
and even their iron limbs must have felt the effects
of journeying full forty miles through the wilderness,&mdash;but
they pushed on with renewed vigor, and, as
the day advanced, observed signs which showed
unmistakably that they were close upon the captors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
The pursuers slackened their gait and advanced
with the extremest caution, for only by doing so
could they hope to succeed in the rescue of the
young girls.</p>

<p>Suddenly the figures of the warriors were discerned
through the trees a short distance ahead.
They had stopped, and were in the act of kindling
a fire, evidently meaning to encamp for the night.
The Indians were startled at the same moment by
sight of the whites hurrying toward them, and not
one of the dusky red-skins could misunderstand what
it meant. Had it been possible for such a misunderstanding,
they were undeceived the next instant.</p>

<p>The pursuers showed their earnestness by not
waiting a moment for the warriors to rally, but
four bringing their rifles to their shoulders, took a
quick aim and fired into the party. The smoke of
the powder had scarcely time to curl upward from
the muzzles of the guns, when the whole eight
charged straight into camp on a dead run, and with
the fury of tigers.</p>

<p>When the Indians saw those figures coming, they
had no time to slay the amazed captives, but,
snatching up only one of their guns, they scattered
pell-mell for the wood. As they went at headlong
haste, Boone and one of his men fired, while still
on a dead run. Each fugitive was "hit hard," but
he managed to get away in the gathering darkness,
and it may safely be concluded that none of the
survivors looked upon that particular expedition
against the settlers at Boonesborough in any other
light than a failure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
The joy of the three girls over the rescue must
be left to the imagination of the reader. They
were terrified almost out of their senses when captured,
but they knew they would soon be missed
from home, and their friends would be on the trail,
but they were old enough to understand the vast
disadvantages under which they would be placed,
knowing that no pursuit could be instituted until
the morrow.</p>

<p>And then, too, they knew the meaning of the
extreme precaution taken by the Indians in separating
and walking so carefully through the densest
of the canebrakes. And, as mile after mile was
placed behind them, and the warm summer day
drew to a close, many a misgiving must have saddened
their hearts, as they looked through the
gathering shadows and failed to see anything of the
loved forms.</p>

<p>But they had come, bursting into camp like
thunderbolts,&mdash;the Indians had fled in terror, and
the girls were restored to their friends without a
hair of their heads being harmed.</p>

<p>The place where the recapture took place was
thick with cane, and some of the pursuers would
have been glad to keep on and inflict further
chastisement upon the Indians,&mdash;but that was impracticable,
and, as the girls were out of danger,
the party turned about and started back toward
Boonesborough, where they arrived without mishap
or further adventure, and where, as may well
be supposed, their return created joy and thanksgiving
throughout the entire settlement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
This incident, one of the most romantic of the
innumerable occurrences of the border, possessed
a significance which some of the settlers failed to
see. The presence of the Indians so near Boonesborough
and the daring abduction was not done
by what may be called an irresponsible company of
warriors. On the contrary, they were one of the
many scouting parties sent out to make observations
of all the settlements along the border, with
a view of organizing a combined movement against
them.</p>

<p>The agents of England, who had been so industriously
at work for months with the Indians of the
West, used means which at last accomplished their
purpose, and, while hostilities were being pushed
with such vigor in the East against the struggling
colonies, it threatened to assume a more desperate
and sanguinary character in the West.</p>

<p>The red men had been aroused to action, and
their manner of warfare was as fierce and merciless
as that prosecuted by the East India Sepoys,
nearly a century later, against Great Britain. It
was not long before the danger was plainly seen,
and so profound was the fear excited by the surety
of the coming war, attended, as it was certain to
be, by the most atrocious massacres, that hundreds
of speculators made all haste to leave the imperiled
country and return to their former homes in the
East.</p>

<p>General Uprising of the Indians&mdash;The Border Rangers&mdash;Attack
upon Boonesborough&mdash;Repulse of the Assailants&mdash;Second
Attack by a Larger Force and its Failure&mdash;Arrival of Forty-five
Men&mdash;Investment of Logan's Fort&mdash;Timely Arrival of Colonel

<p>There was a deliberation and completeness in
the preparations of the Indians against the settlements
along the western border which, if possible,
lent additional terrors to the danger that was soon
to break upon them.</p>

<p>The scouts who came in to Boonesborough, Harrodsburg,
and other points, from their long journeys
through the forest, reported the tribes everywhere
making ready for the warpath. There were
gatherings at their towns, councils, turbulent assemblies,
throwing of the tomahawk, shooting matches,
running races, and that general excitement which
to the experienced forest ranger can mean but the
one thing.</p>

<p>The months passed, the breaking out of hostilities
was delayed, and immigrants kept dropping in,
as may be said, until the month of July, 1777,
when nearly fifty men came in one company and
settled in the immediate vicinity of Boonesborough.</p>

<p>This was a most welcome addition indeed, for it
was evident to all that the hour was at hand when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
every arm would be needed in the defence of their
homes and firesides.</p>

<p>Boone knew what was going on among the surrounding
tribes, and he threw away no chances
and neglected no precautions. His vigilant sentinels
were always on duty, day and night, and
nothing was more certain than that the garrison
could not be taken by surprise.</p>

<p>Besides this, Kenton, Brady, M'Clelland, the
McAfee Brothers, and other rangers, were constantly
moving over the long stretches of forest,
making tours of observation to the Indian villages
and gathering points, so that no excuse existed for
the whites being surprised.</p>

<p>In the month of April, 1777, the sentinels at
Boonesborough discovered suspicious signs in the
woods immediately surrounding them. The signals
and moving figures showed that a large body
of Indians were gathering in front of the stockades,
and there could be no doubt that an attack was
intended upon the station.</p>

<p>The settlers were ready, and when the red men
opened fire, they received such a fierce fusillade in
return, that no doubt could exist as to the injury
inflicted. The Indian fights from the bushes and
hidden places, and is at disadvantage when he is
forced to attack a foe who is equally protected.</p>

<p>From behind the trees the warriors aimed their
rifles, and the flashes of flame here, there, and
everywhere among the green vegetation, showed
where they stood, with their black eyes sighting
along the barrels, waiting to fire at whatever point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
showed any probability of exposing a white enemy
to their accurate aim.</p>

<p>But beyond the stockades and in the blockhouses
were the Kentucky riflemen, whose unerring aim,
whose steady nerve and cool courage have never
been surpassed, and whose skill in the use of their
favorite weapon has made them renowned throughout
the world.</p>

<p>Their guns were thrust out of the loopholes, and
the pioneers seized the first chance offered, no
matter how slight.</p>

<p>Perhaps the jet of fire behind some tree or
among some dense bushes disclosed nothing of the
warrior who caused it, but an instant later, maybe,
the bronzed face of the Indian was cautiously exposed
for a single instant, as he peered out to see
the result of his carefully-aimed shot.</p>

<p>That second was enough, for the half dozen
Kentuckians watched for just such an opportunity,
and like lightning the sharp, whiplike crack of
as many rifles broke the stillness, and the red skin
rolled over backward, his skull riddled by bullets,
while the smoke of his own gun was curling upward
from its muzzle, and the death-yell trembled
half uttered on his coppery lips.</p>

<p>The Indians killed one settler and wounded four
others, while it was never known how many of their
own number were shot. They fought bravely, but
soon saw they had attempted an impossibility and
withdrew.</p>

<p>Boone knew better than to believe this was the
end. On the contrary, he and his comrades were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
convinced it presaged more serious danger to the
settlement.</p>

<p>In this supposition he was right, for on the great
national anniversary following, the Indians reappeared
with fully double their former force, and
began what was intended as a regular siege of
Boonesborough.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed the red-men knew or
had any idea of the associations connected with
that particular date, for the Declaration of Independence
was just a year old; but the fourth of
July is not a fortunate day for a foe to assail an
American force, and so it proved in this instance,
for the whole attack and its result was but a repetition
of that of three months previous.</p>

<p>The Indians fought with great courage, accepting
every chance offered, and killing one man and
wounding four, precisely as they did in April.</p>

<p>The vigilant Kentuckians saw seven of the warriors
drop before their fire, and it is not improbable
that others were slain or at least wounded. The
fight was kept up with little intermission for two
days and nights, at the expiration of which time
the assailants became convinced that no hope of
success remained to them, and they drew off as
before.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Boonesborough, while
in its very infancy, underwent two fierce attacks
from the Indians.</p>

<p>Immediately after the second, came the forty-five
men from the East, and no further disturbance or
molestation took place during that year, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
one of great material advancement on the part of
the settlement. Those who joined it continued to
be of the right material, and they came with the
ambition to rear themselves homes in the western
wilderness, where their families could live in comfort
and safety.</p>

<p>The first step necessary, and in fact about all the
steps necessary, could be summed up in the single
word&mdash;<i>work</i>.</p>

<p>And they put forth all their energies toward
clearing broad spaces of the surrounding forest, and
putting the rich virgin soil under cultivation. It
was of that fertile, vigorous nature that it but
needed the opportunity to bring forth, some a sixty
and some a hundred fold.</p>

<p>It was like that of the famous Green Isle of the
sea,&mdash;"Tickle it with a straw, and it would laugh
a harvest."</p>

<p>Meantime the other stations and settlements
were given a taste of Indian warfare and peril.
Logan's Fort was invested by a large force of
Indians in the month of May, 1777, and it was
placed in imminent danger, for it was not so
strong as Harrodsburg or Boonesborough, and
the investing red-skins were overwhelming in
numbers.</p>

<p>The siege continued for several days and nights,
during which it became plainer and plainer that
the warriors were certain to subdue it, in which
case the garrison would be put to death.</p>

<p>But at the very hour when despair was settling
over the hearts of the brave defenders, Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Bowman appeared with a re-enforcement, and the
Indians were scattered like chaff in the wind.</p>

<p>Two months previous the fort at Harrodsburg
was attacked, but the savages were bravely resisted,
and they retired with a slight loss, having wounded
four of the whites, one of whom afterward died.</p>

<p>One day a boy sixteen years old, who lived
four miles above Harrodsburg, went out in the
woods to hunt game. The name of the lad was
Ray, and he afterward became the General of that
name who is so closely identified with the settlement
of the West.</p>

<p>Like all boys in Kentucky he was a good shot,
and he was not out long before he brought down a
small blue-wing duck, which he picked, dressed,
and roasted to a rich, juicy brown, building his fire
on the brow of a hill, a few rods east of his home.</p>

<p>Just as young Ray had gotten the bird in a
shape to delight the palate of an epicure, a fine,
soldierly-looking man came out of the woods and
called in a cheery voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
"How do you do, my young man?"</p>

<p>The boy looked up in surprise and <span class="locked">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I am very well, sir, thank you."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Ray, and I live in the house down yonder."</p>

<p>"Ain't you afraid to hunt alone in the woods,
when the Indians are making so much trouble?"</p>

<p>"Well, I try to be careful, but there is danger in
these times everywhere, as it seems to me; but
won't you help me eat this duck which is now
ready for the table?"</p>

<p>"I'm obliged to you, for I am quite hungry."</p>

<p>Accordingly he sat down and attacked the duck,
which he remarked was very toothsome, especially
when a person was so a-hungered as he, and complimenting
the boy upon his culinary skill, he kept
at work until there wasn't a particle left for young
Ray, who was somewhat astonished and not altogether
enthusiastic over the style in which his
visitor disposed of the bird.</p>

<p>"But," said General Ray afterward, "he would
have been welcome to all the game I could have
killed, when I afterward became acquainted with
his noble and gallant soul."</p>

<p>When the meal was finished, the visitor thanked
the lad for his hospitality and said:</p>

<p>"My name is Clark, and I have come out to see
what you brave fellows are doing in Kentucky, and
to give you a helping hand if necessary."</p>

<p>Young Ray conducted him to Harrodsburg,
where he spent some time in carefully noting the
capacity of the station in the way of defence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
against the attacks that were pretty certain to be
made very soon.</p>

<p>The gentleman was General George Rogers
Clark, who at the time was a Major in the Army,
and was engaged in forming his grand scheme for
the conquest of the British posts in the Northwest.
He was one of the most conspicuous figures of the
times, and is known in history as the "Hannibal
of the West."</p>

<p>The first visit which he made to the frontier
was in 1775, when he spent several days at Harrodsburg.
His military genius was so well known
that the command of the irregular troops in Kentucky
was given him. He remained in the West
until autumn, when he went back to Virginia, but
returned to Kentucky the succeeding year, which
was the occasion of his introduction to the embryo
General Ray, as we have just related.</p>

<p>At a public meeting of the settlers at Harrodsburg,
held on the 6th of June, 1775, General
George Rogers Clark and Gabriel Jones were
chosen to represent the territory in the Colony of
Virginia. The all-important point at that critical
juncture was whether Virginia would consider the
colony under her protection and render her the
assistance she needed against the combinations of
the Indians.</p>

<p>It will be borne in mind that Colonel Henderson
claimed Kentucky by virtue of purchase from the
Cherokees, and if such claim was recognized, then
no protection could be demanded from Virginia,
no more than from Pennsylvania. In General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Clark's judgment the wiser course was for the
people to appoint agents with the power to
negotiate with Virginia, and in the event of the
State refusing to acknowledge the claim of the
colony upon her, then General Clark proposed to
use the lands of Kentucky as a fund with which
to obtain settlers and establish an independent
State. The sovereign people had determined
otherwise, and with many misgivings as to their
recognition, General Clark and his colleague set
out for the capital of Virginia.</p>

<p>The way was long, and there were no public conveyances
of which to take advantage. When they
reached Williamsburg, the legislature had adjourned
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine die</i>. Thereupon Gabriel Jones made
his way to the settlements on the Holston, while
General Clark, with the resolution to accomplish
something for the imperiled settlers on the frontier,
proceeded to the home of Governor Henry, who
was lying sick in his room.</p>

<p>The Governor was so impressed by the statements
of Clark, that he gave him a letter to the
Executive Council of the State, and, with this
document, the officer hastened to that body, and
briefly but graphically depicting the needs of the
colony, asked the Council to loan him five hundredweight
of powder to be used in the defence of the
several stations.</p>

<p>The members of the Council expressed themselves
as anxious to do everything in their power
for the endangered colonists, but there was a
threatened legal entanglement, which prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
them from making the loan in the manner desired.
On account of the efforts of Colonel Henderson and
Company, the inhabitants of Kentucky had not yet
been recognized as citizens, and until that important
question was settled, the utmost that could be
done was to loan the ammunition to the Kentuckians
as friends, at the same time holding General Clark
personally responsible, in case of the failure of the
State to give citizenship to the colonists.</p>

<p>General Clark lost his patience with this proposition.
He had made his way to Virginia at great
personal risk, to obtain the gunpowder, and he
was ready to give his utmost services in defending
the colony, but he could not admit the justice of
becoming responsible for the value of the ammunition
so sorely needed by the settlements, and he
therefore declined to receive it upon such terms.
Rather than do so, he announced that he would go
back to Kentucky, put in operation his original
scheme, and use all the resources of the territory to
erect it into an independent and sovereign State.</p>

<p>This determination General Clark declared in a
letter to the Council, after taking time to deliberate
fully over the proposition. Its reception produced
a result which he hardly dared hope. The
Council called him before it, reconsidered their
action, and ordered that the powder be sent to
Pittsburg at once, where it was to be turned over
to General Clark to be used in the defence of the
settlements of Kentucky.</p>

<p>This took place in the latter part of August, and
in the autumn of the same year the memorial was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
laid before the Virginia Legislature. The delegates
could not be admitted to seats, but, before the session
was over, they secured legislative action that
marked an epoch in the history of the colony,
which was its erection into the county of Kentucky,
by which it was entitled to a separate county court,
two justices of the peace, a sheriff, constables,
coroners, and militia officers. Thus to General
Clark must be given the credit of securing the first
political organization of Kentucky, by which it was
entitled to representation in the Virginia Assembly,
and to a separate judicial and military establishment.</p>

<p>Having accomplished this important purpose,
General Clark and Gabriel Jones made ready to
start to Kentucky again. The powder and a large
quantity of lead were still at Pittsburg, awaiting
them, and they proceeded to that point and took
charge of the supplies. With seven boatmen they
started on their voyage down the Ohio.</p>

<p>General Clark felt the importance of making all
possible haste in the matter, for the Indians were
sure to attempt its capture if they knew of the
prize passing through their country.</p>

<p>By some means or other they learned the truth,
and the boat, with its small crew, was scarcely out
of sight of Pittsburg, when the Indians appeared
along the banks and began firing upon it with the
hope of disabling the crew. Then they entered
their canoes and began a pursuit of the boat containing
the ammunition.</p>

<p>Without offering resistance, General Clark devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
his energies to flight, and his men plied their
oars with such success that they held the advance
all the way to the mouth of Limestone Creek,
where General Clark resorted to stratagem to save
the valuable property in his hands.</p>

<p>His men had rowed with such unremitting
energy that they could not hold out much longer.
The boat was therefore turned up Limestone
Creek, speeding along between the banks with such
swiftness, that it kept out of sight of the Indians
for a long time.</p>

<p>At the proper point, the craft was run ashore,
the men sprang out, and the powder was concealed
in the bushes. Then the boat was turned adrift,
and the little party started overland for Harrodsburg,
where they arrived without mishap. A few
days later, the General returned with a strong
force, recovered all the ammunition, delivered it at
Harrodsburg, without the loss of a pound, and
shortly after it was distributed among all the stations,
which were thus provided with the indispensable
means of defending themselves against
the impending assaults.</p>

<p>It will be admitted that General George Rogers
Clark did a most important service for Kentucky
in thus furnishing her with ammunition, and in
securing her erection into the County of Kentucky:
but this did not end his services, and when it was
least expected by his enemies, he assumed the
offensive.</p>

<p>General Clark possessed rare military gifts, as he
demonstrated on more than one important occasion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
The Governor of the Canadian settlements in the
Illinois country was using his utmost endeavor
to incite the Indians to devastate the American
frontier. This being established beyond question,
the Governor of Virginia placed two hundred and
fifty men under Clark, with permission to march
against the settlements. He descended the Ohio,
landed and hid his boats, and then started overland
for his destination, his soldiers carrying the small
amount of provisions they had on their backs.
These were soon exhausted, and, for two days,
they ate nothing but roots and a few berries, but
all the time pushed vigorously forward.</p>

<p>As silently as phantoms, and as totally unexpected,
it may be said, they appeared before Kaskaskia
in the dead of night. The place was captured
before anything like resistance could be
thought of. This was a noteworthy exploit, for
Kaskaskia but a short time before had resisted a
much larger force.</p>

<p>General Clark understood the value of promptness
and celerity in military movements, and without
an hour's unnecessary delay he sent out detachments
against three other towns, which in
every instance were captured, the obnoxious Governor
Rocheblave himself being one of the prisoners.
He was sent to Virginia, there being found among
the papers on his person instructions from Quebec
to do his utmost to rouse the Indians against the
settlers, and even to go to the extent of offering
bounties for the scalps of Americans.</p>

<p>The Illinois settlers transferred their allegiance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
to Virginia, which owned the territory by right of
charter and conquest, and, in the autumn of 1778,
erected it into the County of Illinois&mdash;thus sealing
an act of brilliant generalship on the part of Clark,
which has few parallels in the history of the West.</p>

<p>The danger, instead of being over, only deepened,
for Hamilton, the Governor of Detroit, was a resolute
official, and, burning under the smart inflicted
by the audacious American officer, began the
organization of an overwhelming force of British
and Indians, with which to move up the Ohio, to
Fort Pitt, capturing all the settlements on the way,
purposing also to lay siege to Fort Kaskaskia itself.</p>

<p>This was alarming tidings to Clark, who saw no
probability of being able to hold the country,
though he resolved to make its re-conquest dear to
the invaders. The forces which Governor Hamilton
was gathering far outnumbered his and were
equally experienced, and their march up the country
promised to be practically irresistible. Besides
this, the Governor gathered hundreds of Indians,
who were thirsting for the opportunity for massacre
and plunder. Thus, never in the history of
the frontier did a more portentous cloud gather
in its sky.</p>

<p>In this hour of gloom and almost despair, General
Clark learned that Governor Hamilton, who had
reached Fort St. Vincent&mdash;now known as Vincennes&mdash;had
divided his force, by sending most of
the Indians against the adjoining settlements.</p>

<p>This opportunity was similar to those the great
Napoleon was so quick to perceive, nearly a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
century later, and which did so much to establish
his marvelous military genius in the eyes of the
world.</p>

<p>It was in the dead of winter, being February,
1779, and yet the runner had scarcely come into
Kaskaskia with the important tidings, when General
Clark, with one hundred and fifty picked men, was
threading his way through the wilderness in the
direction of Vincennes. Fortunately the weather
was unusually mild, but when within nine miles of
the enemy, they reached the drowned lands of the
Wabash, where they were compelled to wade to
their armpits for a long distance, and to use so
much caution in advancing, that it was five days
before the entire body got safely across.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of February, the American force
appeared before the fort, and General Clark demanded
its surrender. This was promptly refused,
and Clark made his preparations to take it. As
the garrison had not expected them, he began a
siege, carefully investing it as best he could, and
confident that it could not hold out long.</p>

<p>So it proved. At the end of eighteen hours it
was surrendered by Governor Hamilton, the Americans
not losing a man. The governor was sent
a prisoner to Williamsburg, and a large quantity of
stores fell into the hands of General Clark.</p>

<p>This was a brilliant achievement indeed, but it
was not all. General Clark captured a convoy
from Canada on its way to the post which had just
surrendered, and secured the mail, $45,000, and
forty prisoners. Shortly after an express arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
from Virginia, thanking him and his gallant companions
for the reduction of the Kaskaskia country;
and not long after, Virginia, through the
agency of General Clark, extended her western
establishments and erected a number of fortifications.</p>

Siege Raised.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have been compelled, in the preceding chapter,
to carry forward for a few years the history of
the military and political movements connected
with the earlier history of Kentucky in order to
give an intelligent idea of the work performed by
its great pioneer Daniel Boone.</p>

<p>During the exciting military occurrences to
which we have referred, Boonesborough was stirred
by a startling disaster.</p>

<p>The settlement was greatly in need of salt, and,
as it was a work of extreme difficulty and danger
to secure its importation from the Atlantic States,
the much simpler method was resorted to of having
it manufactured at the Blue Licks, where there
was such an abundance of brackish water that the
work was easily done.</p>

<p>Collecting some thirty men, Boone set out for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
the Blue Licks which were at no great distance,
and they began immediately the process of evaporating
the water and collecting the saline deposit.
Salt is one of the prime necessities of life, and they
were desirous of making enough of it to last them
for a long time to come.</p>

<p>The operation of salt-making is not a complicated
one, even in these modern days, and there was
scarcely the work to keep the whole thirty men
busy all the time. As might be supposed, Boone
spent many hours in hunting.</p>

<p>It is probable that the Indians, learning of the
weakened condition of Boonesborough, had determined
on attacking it with a force which promised
to insure its capture. For this purpose they
gathered two hundred warriors and started for the
settlement, without Boone or any of his party suspecting
the danger that was moving down upon
their friends.</p>

<p>Still further, knowing that the unsuspicious
white men were engaged at the Licks, the large
force of Indians turned in that direction and advanced
with the noiselessness of so many shadows.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone, at that juncture, was alone, hunting
in the woods, when he came face to face with
the two hundred warriors, who appeared as suddenly
as if cast up by the earth.</p>

<p>Without stopping to parley, Boone whirled about
and started on a dead run, darting in and out
among the trees, doing his utmost to dodge the
bullets that he expected would be sent after him,
and to place himself beyond sight of the Indians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
who were desirous of securing so renowned a man
as he.</p>

<p>But Boone was not so young as when he had his
former desperate encounters with the red men,
and the dozen warriors who instantly sped after
him were among the fleetest of their tribe.</p>

<p>The pioneer made good progress, but as he
glanced furtively over his shoulder every few
seconds, he saw that the savages were gaining
rapidly upon him, and his capture was certain. He
held out as long as there was the slightest hope,
but soon abruptly halted and surrendered.</p>

<p>There is something singular in the consideration
which the Indians showed Boone on more than
one occasion. It will be remembered that when
he and Stuart were captured, they were kept day
after day, until they gained a chance to escape;
and, in the present instance, the captors conducted
him back to the main body, where he was still held
a prisoner, no harm being offered him.</p>

<p>This was at a time when the fury of the savages
was stirred to the highest point against the settlers,
and when the treacherous bullet, the crashing
tomahawk, the deadly knife and the smoke of the
burning cabin were more typical of the manner of
warfare, than were any of the amenities of civilized,
contending forces.</p>

<p>It may have been the Indians recognized the importance
of the capture they had made in the person
of the great Daniel Boone, for they treated
him kindly and conducted him back to the Blue
Licks, where the rest of the settlers were encamped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
There, upon the solemn promise of the Indians to
spare their lives and give them good treatment,
Boone surrendered the entire command to them.</p>

<p>Boone was court-martialed for this act, and,
whether he deserved credit for it or not, is hard to
determine. Such a daring officer as General Clark
never would have surrendered under such circumstances,
and thirty frontiersmen of to-day would
give a good account of themselves against an aboriginal
force of ten times their number.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the partisans of the pioneer
plead that he saw that it was unquestionably the
best thing to be done, inasmuch as the majority of
the Indians would turn back with their prisoners,
and thus Boonesborough would be saved from an
attack, which, in its weakened condition, it would
scarcely be able to resist.</p>

<p>It will be seen that this is not a conclusive
argument by any means, for if the war party had
appeared before the stockades with the thirty
prisoners and threatened to put them to the torture,
before the eyes of their families, they could
have secured any terms they chose. On the other
hand, the two hundred savages could have exterminated
the little band in the woods as utterly as did
Sitting Bull and his warriors the forces of General
Custer nearly a hundred years later. It may be set
down, therefore, that the court-martial which acquitted
Boone, voiced the sober second thought of
his friends in this much disputed matter.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that the Indians felt
a genuine admiration for the pioneer, for they kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
in spirit and letter the agreement they made respecting
the treatment of himself and comrades.
The capture of so large a force, including the
leader himself, was an achievement on the part of
the Indians calling for great self-congratulation, as
they started with their captives for old Chillicothe,
on the Miami.</p>

<p>Old Chillicothe was the principal town of the
Shawanoes who had taken Boone, and as it was in
the depth of winter, the march through the wilderness
occupying three days was very severe. On
this journey the Indians treated the whites well,
sharing their food with them, and only showing by
their unremitting vigilance that they regarded them
in the light of prisoners.</p>

<p>They were kept at the Shawanoe village several
weeks, and then the pioneer and ten of his men
were conducted to Detroit (which at that time
was a British garrison), and, with the exception of
Boone, were presented to the commandant, who
showed them much consideration.</p>

<p>The commandant was desirous of securing
Boone, and requested the Indians to bring him in,
but they refused. A number of prominent gentlemen
in Detroit, who knew of the pioneer, joined
with the officer in offering a large reward for Boone,
with the purpose of exchange, or of sending him
back to his family at Boonesborough.</p>

<p>The Shawanoes were deaf to the proffers, and, to
end the annoyance, started for their villages on the
Miami, taking the leader with them.</p>

<p>The truth was, the red-men had formed a feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
of strong friendship for their famous prisoner, and
were determined to adopt him. It was with such
an intention that they left Detroit and made their
way through the woods to their own towns, occupying
more than two weeks in the journey.</p>

<p>Reaching their destination at last, Boone was
formally adopted into the Shawanoe tribe. Respecting
this novel ceremony, Peck, the biographer
of Boone, says:</p>

<p>"The forms of the ceremony of adoption were
often severe and ludicrous. The hair of the head
is plucked out by a painful and tedious operation,
leaving a tuft some three or four inches in diameter
on the crown for the scalp-lock, which is cut and
dressed up with ribbons and feathers. The candidate
is then taken into the river in a state of
nudity, and there thoroughly washed and rubbed,
'to take all his white blood out.' This ablution is
usually performed by females. He is then taken
to the council-house, where the chief makes a
speech, in which he expatiates upon the distinguished
honors conferred on him. His head and
face are painted in the most approved and fashionable
style, and the ceremony is concluded with a
grand feast and smoking."</p>

<p>Boone had now been changed from a white to a
red man; that is, in the eyes of the red-men themselves,
and his native shrewdness and cunning told
him that his true course was so to conduct himself
as to give the Shawanoes the impression that he
shared their opinion with them.</p>

<p>Having received the ceremony of adoption, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
well aware of the strong friendship the members of
the tribe felt for him, he knew he was in no personal
danger, so long as he chose to remain one of them.</p>

<p>But nothing could be further from his intentions
than that of spending any considerable time with
the Shawanoes, but he was well aware that but
one opportunity of escape would be offered him;
should he fail, no second chance would present
itself. It will therefore be seen that no precaution
was to be neglected that promised to add to the
prospect of success.</p>

<p>He could not but feel anxious concerning his
wife and children, and he was uneasy over the situation
of Boonesborough; so much so, that he resolved
to seize the first opportunity of leaving, and
to press his efforts with such vigor that he could
scarcely fail.</p>

<p>He adopted his old custom of pretending to be
satisfied with his condition, and of holding no
thought of running away. Although little else
was left for him to do, it was not to be expected
that it would deceive the Indians or lead them to
relax their vigilance to any perceptible extent.
They must have known it was the very stratagem
he had adopted successfully a few years before with
their people, besides being the one which would
naturally occur to a prisoner.</p>

<p>In the month of June, 1778, a company of Shawanoes
went to the Sciota Licks to make salt, taking
Boone with them. He thought the chance promised
to be a good one for getting away, and he was
on the alert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
But the Indians were equally so, and they kept
him so busy over the kettles that he dared not
make the attempt. Finally, having secured all
they wished of salt, they started homeward again,
and reaching old Chillicothe, Boone's heart was
filled with consternation at the sight of 450 warriors
in their paint, fully armed and ready to
march upon Boonesborough.</p>

<p>This was a formidable force indeed, more than
double that against which the garrison had ever
been forced to defend themselves, and it seemed to
the pioneer as if the settlement, his family and all
his friends were doomed to destruction.</p>

<p>It was now or never with Boone: if his escape
was to prove of any benefit to others than himself,
it would not do to delay it any longer. The settlers
were unaware of their danger and unless duly
warned, were likely to fall victims to Shawanoe
cunning and atrocity.</p>

<p>Boone determined to leave within the succeeding
twenty-four hours, no matter how desperate the
chance, and once beyond sight of his captors, he
would push forward night and day until he could
reach Boonesborough.</p>

<p>But eager as he was to go, no opportunity presented
itself that day or evening. His active brain
continued busily at work, and, before he closed his
eyes in snatches of fitful slumber, he had decided
on the course to pursue.</p>

<p>He rose early the next morning, and started
out for a short hunt, as he had frequently done, for
such a stratagem promised to give him more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
chance of getting a good start of his pursuers, it
being naturally supposed that the hour of a hunter's
return is one of the most uncertain occurrences
in this world.</p>

<p>The pioneer was one hundred and sixty miles
from Boonesborough, but he was scarcely out of
sight of the Indians, when he headed straight for
the settlement, and ran like a man who realizes it
is a case of life and death. It was a long distance
to tramp, where the need was so urgent, but the
fugitive was spurred on by the strongest of all
incentives.</p>

<p>He did not spare himself. He had concealed
enough for one meal about his person before starting,
and this was all he ate while making the long
journey occupying five days. He did not dare to
stop long enough to shoot any game, for fear his
pursuers would be upon him. He took many precautions
to conceal his trail, but was fearful that
the piercing eyes of the Shawanoes would not be
deceived. He was apprehensive, too, that if he
should fire his gun, the report would bring his
vengeful captors upon him.</p>

<p>Climbing some elevation, he looked searchingly
back over the route traveled, for sight of the smoke
of the tell-tale camp-fire, or that of the moving
figures close on his trail.</p>

<p>But he saw none, and at the close of the fifth
day, tired, hungry, and worn, he made his appearance
in front of the Boonesborough stockade and
was admitted with amazement and delight by his
friends, who believed he had been killed long before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
So general, indeed, was this belief in his
death that his wife and family had moved back to
their home in North Carolina some time previous.</p>

<p>Just as he had feared, he found the station in
the very condition to fall a prey to the Indians.
Its immunity from attack for months previous
had induced carelessness and indifference, and had
the immense war party of Shawanoes appeared at
the same time with the pioneer, the fort could
not have held out an hour before a vigorous
attack.</p>

<p>But Boone's presence inspired courage, and the
garrison and settlers set to work instantly. Everything
was done to put the station in the best possible
state for defence. There was not an hour to
lose, for it was supposed the savages would be
directly upon the heels of the pioneer, and a constant
and vigilant lookout was maintained.</p>

<p>But the hours passed, and no Indians appeared:
in fact, the escape of Boone proved the salvation of
the settlement named after him, in a manner altogether
unsuspected.</p>

<p>Shortly after the flight of the pioneer, another
of his friends succeeded in getting away, and he
came into the station with the gratifying news that
the march against Boonesborough had been postponed
for three weeks on account of the flight of
Boone, whose purpose was divined at once by the
Indians.</p>

<p>This postponement was a most providential
thing, not only for Boonesborough itself, but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
all the stations along the frontier, for it gave them
time in which to make every preparation for the
attacks which were foreshadowed by the Indian
spies that were encountered in every direction.</p>

<p>Finally Boone determined to make an offensive
movement, with a view of striking something like
fear into the hearts of the Indians who were meditating
these attacks, and exciting a corresponding
degree of confidence among his friends.</p>

<p>On a bright morning early in August, with nineteen
picked men, he left the station and started for
one of the Indian towns on the Sciota, intending to
effect its capture before anything like an effective
resistance could be made.</p>

<p>To accomplish such a work in an Indian country,
requires the utmost secrecy and celerity of
movement. No time, therefore, was lost on the
road, when once the start was made, and, threading
their way rapidly through the forest, they advanced
straight toward the Indian town, and were within
a few miles, when, to their astonishment, they encountered
thirty of its warriors who were hurrying
to join the main body that at that moment was
marching against Boonesborough.</p>

<p>The instant the forces caught sight of each
other, a regular bushwhacking fire began, lasting
only a few minutes, when the Indians broke and
fled, having one brave killed and two wounded.
None of the whites were hurt, and they captured
several horses and such property as the Indians
could not take away with them.</p>

<p>Two of the swiftest runners were instantly sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
to the Indian town, and they came back with news
that it was evacuated. The flank movement, therefore,
of the settlers had accomplished nothing.</p>

<p>Only one thing remained to be done: the Indians
were moving upon Boonesborough, but there was a
possibility of Boone and his men getting there
ahead of them. They turned about and the race
began.</p>

<p>On the sixth day, Boone found himself at the
same distance from Boonesborough as was the
main body; by the exercise of great care, he and
his men avoided observation and got ahead of
them, reaching the station on the seventh day,
while the formidable enemy made their appearance
before the town on the eighth day.</p>

<p>The war party was a large one, indeed, and
looked irresistible. It had the British banners flying,
and was commanded by Captain Duquesne,
with eleven other Canadian Frenchmen and a number
of the most prominent Indian chiefs, while the
woods seemed to be literally alive with warriors.
Many a settler, as he looked out upon the
scene, felt that resistance to such a force was useless
and the end of Boonesborough was close at
hand.</p>

<p>Captain Duquesne, with great confidence in his
ability to capture the place, sent in a demand to
Captain Boone to surrender it at once in the name
of his Britannic Majesty. Boone, in reply, asked
to be allowed two days in which to consider
the summons, and Duquesne granted the request.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Boone at once summoned his friends to council,
and found, when they were gathered, that there
were only fifty; but, after a full interchange of
views, they decided to defend the station to the
last man. The investing force numbered at the
least calculation fully ten times as many as they,
and a prolonged resistance would be sure to excite
them to the highest degree of fury; but the resolution
was unanimous, and there was no faltering
on the part of the intrepid commander or any of
his comrades.</p>

<p>At the expiration of the two days, Boone appeared
at one of the bastions and announced his
intention of defending the place, at the same time
thanking the French commander for his courtesy
in giving him the forty-eight hours in which to
make his preparations against attack.</p>

<p>Captain Duquesne was surprised and disappointed
over this decision, for he seems to have
been confident that the settlers, after soberly thinking
over and discussing the matter, would see not
only the uselessness, but the suicidal folly of a
resistance, which would exasperate the Indians,
who would be irrestrainable in their vengeance,
after the fall of the station.</p>

<p>The British commander was so anxious to
secure the surrender of Boonesborough, that he
immediately proposed more advantageous terms,
making them so liberal, indeed, that Boone and
eight of his companions accepted the invitation
to go outside with a view of holding a conference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Boone and his escort went forth in good faith,
but they had not been in the clearing long when it
became evident that a trap was set and treachery
intended.</p>

<p>By a sudden concerted movement, the whites
escaped from the Shawanoes, who were seeking to
surround them, and dashing into the gates, closed
them and hastened to the bastions, where they
stood ready to answer the British captain at the
muzzle of the rifle.</p>

<p>The fight commenced at once, a hot fire being
opened from every direction upon the fort, but the
pioneers returned it so sharply, and with such precision,
that the Indians were forced to shelter
themselves behind stumps and trees, from which
they could discharge their guns with less certainty
of aim.</p>

<p>Captain Duquesne gained a more appreciative
idea of the skill of the Kentucky marksmen than
he had ever held before, for the station was not
only well guarded on every side, but it seemed impossible
for a warrior to show himself for a second
without being perforated by some settler, whose
rifle sent out its sharp, whiplike crack, whenever
an "opening" presented itself.</p>

<p>So ceaseless was the vigilance of the whites, and
so accurate and deadly their aim, that Captain
Duquesne quickly perceived that despite the overwhelming
numbers at his command, he would
have to try some other method other than the
desultory firing, which promised to accomplish
absolutely nothing at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
He therefore determined to undermine and blow
up the garrison.</p>

<p>It was not quite two hundred feet from the fort
to the bank of the river, where the Canadians and
Indians at once began digging in the direction of
the stockades.</p>

<p>But the dangerous work of mining is always
open to defeat by countermining, as was proven by
the gallant defenders of Fort Presq'Isle, when they
were so sorely pressed, and Boone instantly set his
men at work.</p>

<p>As the dirt was cast up, it was also thrown over
the pickets, the purpose being that Captain Duquesne
should be apprised that his scheme was discovered,
and the settlers were engaged in the same
proceedings.</p>

<p>Boone learned what the besiegers were doing, by
observing that the water below the fort was muddy,
while it was clear above.</p>

<p>Captain Duquesne saw that it was idle to prosecute
this method of attack, when the enemy were
countermining, and he gave it over.</p>

<p>But he had with him, as we have shown, the
most formidable force that in all the history of
Boonesborough was ever gathered before it, and
he doubted not that it must fall before a regular
siege.</p>

<p>Accordingly he invested it, intending to starve
the garrison into submission, if no other method
presented itself, for there was nothing to be feared
in the way of re-enforcements coming to the
assistance of the defenders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
The siege lasted nine days. During this time,
the settlers had only two men killed, while some
of the besiegers were constantly falling before their
deadly rifles. They could accomplish nothing,
and Captain Duquesne decided to raise the siege.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Peculiar Position of Boonesborough&mdash;Boone rejoins his
Family in North Carolina&mdash;Returns to Boonesborough&mdash;Robbed
of a Large Amount of Money&mdash;Increased Emigration
to the West&mdash;Colonel Rogers and his Party almost Annihilated&mdash;Captain
Denham's Strange Adventure.</p></blockquote>

<p>It must have caused Captain Duquesne great
mortification to come to this conclusion, after setting
out with a force ten times as great as that
against which he contended, and with every reason
to count upon success; but his provisions were
almost exhausted, and nearly every time he heard
the sharp crack of a rifle from the defences it
meant that he had one less warrior than before.
The prospect of his triumph was diminishing
slowly, but none the less steadily, day by day.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances there was but one
thing to do, and that was to raise the siege. This
was done at the close of the ninth day after the
attack, having lost, as is stated, thirty-seven men,
with a much larger number wounded.</p>

<p>Boonesborough was never again subjected to a
formidable assault by Indians. It had gone through
its crucial period, and there was many a day and
hour when it seemed certain that the advanced
station in the wilderness must succumb to the
hordes of Indians who, like so many fierce bloodhounds,
were bounding against the stockades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
A peculiar condition of the settlement of the
West now acted as a shield to Boonesborough.
Between the site of the station and the Ohio River
were continually springing up smaller stations,
and many of these were so weak as to invite attack,
while Boonesborough had proved her powers of
resistance.</p>

<p>The Indians were too wise to pass beyond the
weaker stations with a view of attacking one further
away and much stronger. It therefore came to
pass, as already stated, that the siege of which we
have made mention was the last danger to which
Boonesborough was subjected.</p>

<p>Something like peace and quietness came to the
station, where every stockade was pierced with
bullets, and the settlers began more earnestly the
work of clearing the land for cultivation.</p>

<p>The opportunity having presented itself for the
first time, Boone set out for North Carolina to join
his family. As they were mourning him for dead,
their excitement and delight possibly may be
imagined, when the hardy hunter came smilingly
out of the woods, and, catching up his little ones
in his arms, kissed them over and over again and
pressed his happy wife to his heart.</p>

<p>He had a strange story to tell them of his captivity
among the Indians&mdash;his escape, his tramp
through the forest, the attack upon Boonesborough
and the repulse of the British and Indians, and
finally his long journey over mountain and wood to
rejoin them.</p>

<p>Boone stayed in North Carolina all winter with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
his family, who doubtless would have been glad to
remain there still longer; but the fires of the Revolution
were flaming and bringing great suffering and
privation, and the pioneer showed that Boonesborough
could never again be placed in serious
peril.</p>

<p>The following summer, therefore, Boone and his
family went back to the station, where he set the
good example of devoting his energies to the cultivation
of the tract of land which belonged to him,
and to assisting other immigrants that were pouring
into the country. This was a work as substantial
in its way as roaming the woods in search of
game, as was his favorite custom in his earlier
days.</p>

<p>And yet, while thus engaged, he was subjected
to a great annoyance if not humiliation. He was
openly accused of cowardice for his surrender of his
party at the Blue Licks the preceding year. Colonel
Richard Callaway and Colonel Benjamin Logan
brought charges against him, which, as hinted in
another place, led to his trial by court-martial.
His two friends were induced to do this as an act
of justice to Boone, and with a view of setting at
rest the accusations continually made in certain
quarters.</p>

<p>Without giving the particulars of the court-martial,
it is sufficient to mention as its direct result,
Captain Boone's promotion to the rank of
major and his increased popularity with all his
citizens.</p>

<p>A misfortune, however, overtook the pioneer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
which probably caused him more mental suffering
than anything that took place during his long,
eventful life.</p>

<p>A commission having been appointed by legislature
to settle Kentucky land claims, Major Boone
attested his faith in the future of the young State
by gathering all his funds, with which he started
for Richmond, with the intention of investing the
entire amount in lands.</p>

<p>On the road he was robbed of every dollar.
Boone makes no mention of the distressing circumstance
in his autobiography, and none of the particulars
are known; but, as he had a great many
sums entrusted to him by friends, it will be understood
that this misfortune amounted in reality to
a public calamity.</p>

<p>However, the robbery did not impair the confidence
which was generally felt in Boone's integrity.
Those who knew him best, knew he was the soul of
honor,&mdash;one who would undergo privation and
suffering at any time rather than inflict it upon
others.</p>

<p>The opinion of the people is best shown in the
following letter written by Colonel Thomas Hart, of
Lexington, Kentucky, dated Grayfields, August 3,
1780:</p>

<p>"I observe what you say respecting our losses by
Daniel Boone. (Boone had been robbed of funds
in part belonging to T. and N. Hart). I had heard
of the misfortune soon after it happened, but not
of my being partaker before now. I feel for the
poor people who, perhaps, are to lose their preemptions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
but I must say, I feel more for Boone,
whose character I am told suffers by it. Much degenerated
must the people of this age be, when
among them are to be found men to censure and
blast the reputation of a person so just and upright,
and in whose breast is a seat of virtue too pure
to admit of a thought so base and dishonorable.
I have known Boone in times of old, when poverty
and distress had him fast by the hand; and in
these wretched circumstances, I have ever found
him of a noble and generous soul, despising every
thing mean; and therefore I will freely grant him
a discharge for whatever sums of mine he might
have been possessed of at the time."</p>

<p>There was general peace, so to speak, along the
frontier, and that part of our country took immense
strides in the march of civilization; and yet
the year 1779 is noted for the occurrence of one of
the bloodiest battles that ever was fought in that
portion of the West.</p>

<p>In the autumn of the year, Colonel Rogers, who
had been to New Orleans to procure supplies for
the posts on the upper Mississippi, made his way
back until he came opposite the present site of
Cincinnati.</p>

<p>As he reached that point he discovered the Indians
coming out of the mouth of the Little Miami,
in a large number of canoes, and crossing to the
Kentucky side of the Ohio. He determined at
once to attempt a surprise, with a view of cutting
them off, as they effected a landing.</p>

<p>The Ohio was quite low at that season, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
very shallow on the southern shore, a long sand-bar
extending along the bank. Colonel Rogers landed
his men, some seventy in number, upon this bar,
and started them for a point a short distance away,
where he hoped to effect the capture of the entire
party of Indians.</p>

<p>But Rogers had made a most fearful miscalculation.</p>

<p>They had scarcely started toward the spot, when
they were fiercely attacked by a large force of Indians,
numbering fully two hundred. They first
poured in a terrible volley and then springing to
their feet, rushed upon the panic-stricken whites,
with their knives and tomahawks. Before this
hurricane-like charge, Colonel Rogers and more
than forty of his men were almost instantly killed.
Those who were not shot down, made a frenzied
flight to the river, with the warriors at their heels.</p>

<p>But the guards left in charge of the boats were so
terrified by the disaster, that they hurriedly rowed
out in the river again, without waiting to take
their imperiled comrades aboard.</p>

<p>Caught thus between two fires, the remnants
turned about, and, making a desperate charge upon
their enemies, succeeded in forcing their way
through the furious warriors, and those who survived
managed to reach Harrodsburg.</p>

<p>In this battle, or massacre, as it may well be
called, sixty whites, including the commander,
Colonel Rogers, were killed, a loss only equaled
by that of the Blue Licks some time previous.
The disaster spread a gloom over the frontier, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
awakened a dread in some quarters that the Indians
would be roused to combined action against
the settlements, and that a long series of disasters
were likely to follow.</p>

<p>It was at this battle that an incident took place,
almost too incredible for belief, but it is established
upon the best authority.</p>

<p>Among those who were wounded by the terrific
volley poured into the whites was Captain Denham,
who was shot through both hips in such a manner
that the bones were broken, and he was deprived
of the use of his legs. Nevertheless he managed
to drag himself to the top of a fallen tree hard by,
where he hid himself until the battle was over and
the Indians gone.</p>

<p>His condition was deplorable, for as his friends
had fled, he could not expect any assistance, and
it looked indeed as if it would have been a mercy
had he been killed outright.</p>

<p>However, he kept up a brave heart and was able
to reach the side of the river to drink, when his
consuming thirst came upon him. Thus he lived
until the close of the second day, when he discovered
that some one else was hiding near him.
Whoever he was, the captain concluded it must
be a wounded person and most likely one of his
own race, inasmuch as the Indians always take off
their wounded when the opportunity is presented
them.</p>

<p>Accordingly the captain hailed him, and sure
enough found it was a comrade, who was wounded
in both arms, so as to make them useless. Both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
were plucky soldiers, and as there seemed to be a
man "between them," they formed a strange
partnership.</p>

<p>The captain did the shooting, while his friend
carried him about on his shoulders, from place to
place.</p>

<p>In this manner they existed until the 27th of
September, when they hailed a passing flat-boat,
which took them to Louisville, where they eventually
recovered and lived many years afterward.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Colonel Bowman's Expedition&mdash;Its Disastrous Failure&mdash;Death
of Boone's Son&mdash;Escape of Boone&mdash;Colonel Byrd's Invasion&mdash;Capture
of Ruddell's and Martin's Station&mdash;Daring Escape of
Captain Hinkston.</p></blockquote>

<p>An invasion of the Indian country is always
popular on the frontier, and when Colonel Bowman,
known to be a good soldier, issued his call for
volunteers, shortly after the massacre of Colonel
Rogers and his command, there was no lack of
responses.</p>

<p>He requested them to meet at Harrodsburg, for
the purpose of moving against the Indian town of
Chillicothe, and there in a short time were gathered
three hundred men, among them being the veteran
Indian fighters, Harrod and Logan, each holding
rank as Captain, but Boone was not a member of
the expedition.</p>

<p>The company was a formidable one, and it started
from Harrodsburg in the month of July, pressing
forward through the woods with such celerity and
skill that it reached the neighborhood of the
Indian towns at nightfall without its approach
being suspected.</p>

<p>Here a consultation was held, and it was decided
to attack the place at the favorite hour of the
savages&mdash;just before the break of day&mdash;and the
plan of assault was agreed upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Advancing close to the Indian town, the little
army separated into two equal divisions, Colonel
Bowman retaining command of one, while Captain
Logan led the other. The latter officer was to
move half way round the town, while the Colonel
was to go the other way, until they met, when the
superior officer would give the signal for an attack
"all along the line."</p>

<p>Captain Logan obeyed his orders promptly, and,
reaching the point agreed upon, halted and awaited
his superior. But unaccountably Colonel Bowman
did not appear.</p>

<p>Logan remained motionless until his impatience
gave way to uneasiness, as he saw the minutes
slipping by, and he determined to find out the
cause of the delay. His men were concealed in the
long grass, when the light of day broke over the
woods, but Logan, moving here and there, could
learn nothing of his superior.</p>

<p>Several of his own men, in shifting their positions,
the better to hide themselves, attracted the
attention of some Indian dogs, which instantly set
up a barking. This brought out a warrior, who
moved cautiously in the direction where the object
that alarmed the canine seemed to be. He probably
had no thought that white men were near at
hand, and he might have been made prisoner, but,
as is often the case, and as seems to have been the
rule on the frontier, at the very crisis the whites
committed a fatal piece of carelessness. One of the
hunters fired his gun.</p>

<p>As quick as lightning the truth flashed upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
warrior, and whirling about, he ran like a deer to
his cabin. In an incredibly short space of time, the
entire village was alarmed. Logan plainly heard
the Shawanoes hurrying the women and children
to the woods, through the cover of a ridge stretching
between them and the other division of
soldiers.</p>

<p>Meantime the warriors prepared themselves for
the attack, by gathering with their guns in a strong
cabin, doubtless intended as a fort or means of
defence, while Logan and his men took possession
of a number of lodges from which the savages had
withdrawn.</p>

<p>He determined upon using the material of these
simple structures as shields in reaching the stronghold
of the Shawanoes, and his men were about to
make the advance, confident of success, when
orders came from Colonel Bowman to retreat at
once.</p>

<p>The Colonel discovered that the Indians had not
been completely surprised, as was intended, and
he thought it too dangerous to venture upon an
attack under such conditions&mdash;hence the order to
Captain Logan to extricate his force while there
was opportunity of doing so.</p>

<p>The order was received with amazement, but
there was no choice but to obey, "though they
knew some one had blundered." The position of
the assailants was such that an orderly retreat was
difficult, and it soon became impossible; the men
felt that each must look out for himself, and they
broke and scattered for the wood, running the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
gauntlet of the destructive fire of the warriors, who
shot, as may be said, at their leisure.</p>

<p>After the loss of several lives Logan's force got
out of its dangerous advanced position, joined the
other division under command of Colonel Bowman,
and the retreat was continued in the direction
of Harrodsburg with some semblance of order.</p>

<p>But nothing gives a foe greater courage than
the sight of a retreating opponent, and when the
Shawanoes saw the strong force of volunteers hurrying
away, they too rushed from their fort and
assailed them. There were less than fifty warriors,
while the whites numbered almost six times as
many, and yet the retreat was continued in the
face of the insignificant number of savages, who
fired upon them from every point of vantage, the
settlers continually falling back, as did the British
before the galling shots of the volunteers at Lexington.</p>

<p>There have been those who defended the course
of Colonel Bowman in this distressing affair, and
who insist that his only course was to retreat before
the attack of a much more numerous force than
his own, but it seems clear he lost his head from
the moment he came in sight of the village. He
failed to comply with his share of the movement
as arranged by himself, and when the Shawanoes
rallied and pursued his men, instead of turning
about and scattering them, he continued retreating
in a disorderly fashion, giving no orders, but allowing
every one to do as he thought best.</p>

<p>But some of his subordinates were better officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
than he, and when the Colonel halted his force in
the worst possible position, Logan, Harrod, and
several others mounted the pack-horses and dashed
through the woods in the direction of the galling
shots. The noted Blackfish was leading the warriors,
and unless checked, the indications were that
the whites would be cut off to a man.</p>

<p>Captains Logan and Harrod, with their brave
comrades, charged wherever they caught sight of
Indians, or whenever the flash of a gun was seen,
and after some vigorous work, they killed the chief
Blackfish and dispersed the rest of his warriors.</p>

<p>The road thus cleared, Colonel Bowman's crippled
command continued its retreat, and finally
reached Harrodsburg without further molestation.</p>

<p>The expedition had proven itself one of that
long list of failures and disasters which mark the
history of military expeditions against the Indians
on the frontier from the earliest settlement down
to the massacre of Custer and his command.</p>

<p>The Revolution was approaching its close, it
being the year 1780, and hundreds of settlers from
the East had swarmed into Kentucky and taken
up land. In their eagerness to acquire possession,
they almost forgot the danger which hung over
them, laying themselves so invitingly open to
attack, that the British and Indians took up the
gauntlet which, it may be said, was thus thrown in
their faces.</p>

<p>The conquest of Kentucky was a favorite scheme
with the British, and in the summer of 1780, a
formidable invasion was made under the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of Colonel Byrd, at the head of six hundred
Indians and Canadians, and with six pieces of
artillery.</p>

<p>His first demonstration was against Ruddell's
station, on the Licking. This had a weak garrison,
and when Captain Ruddell was confronted with the
formidable force and summoned to surrender,
he saw that it would be folly to refuse. The
artillery at the command of his foe could speedily
batter the fort to pieces, and he agreed to capitulate
on condition that his garrison should be
under the protection of the British. Colonel Byrd
readily agreed to this reasonable stipulation, and
the gates were thrown open.</p>

<p>The instant this was done, the Indians poured
tumultuously in, and laying hold of the soldiers
claimed them as prisoners. Captain Ruddell remonstrated
indignantly with Colonel Byrd at this
violation of his agreement, but the British colonel,
although he did his best to restrain his Indians,
was unable to do so.</p>

<p>Colonel Byrd seems to have been a gentleman,
and, when the Indians proposed to attack Martin's
Station, a short distance off, and which they were
confident of capturing, he refused to move and
threatened to withdraw from Kentucky altogether,
unless the chiefs and sachems should pledge themselves
that in every case the prisoners taken should
be given in charge of him, the Indians confining
themselves entirely to the plunder and booty obtained.</p>

<p>The agreement was made on the part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
leaders, and then Colonel Byrd marched against
Martin's Station. The artillery he took along undoubtedly
proved irresistibly persuasive in almost
every instance, for he captured the station with
little difficulty, and the Indian chiefs compelled
their warriors to adhere to the pledge they had
given.</p>

<p>The Indians now became eager to attack Bryant's
Station, but Colonel Byrd did not seem to have
much enthusiasm over the invasion of Kentucky,
and he declined to go further. He collected his
stores, and, placing them upon boats, retreated to
Licking Forks, where his Indians withdrew, taking
with them the prisoners captured at Ruddell's
Station.</p>

<p>Among the captives was Captain John Hinkston,
a noted Indian fighter, who, as may be supposed,
was on the alert for a chance to get away from
his captors, knowing, as he did, that he was liable
to suffer torture at their hands.</p>

<p>On the second night, succeeding the separation
of the Indians from the command of Colonel Byrd,
the warriors halted close to the river. When they
started to build a camp-fire, the fuel was found to
be so wet that it was fully dark before they could
get the flames going, and so many of the guard
were called upon to assist in the difficult work
that Captain Hinkston made a sudden dash, broke
through the lines, and amid a storm of hastily
aimed bullets succeeded in reaching the shelter
of the woods.</p>

<p>As night had just settled, Hinkston felt secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
in his escape, though the Indians immediately scattered
and began such a vigorous search that he
heard them moving in all directions about him,
sometimes so close that he could almost touch
them, and was forced to stand as motionless as the
tree trunks beside him, lest they should detect his
cautious movements.</p>

<p>But he gradually worked away from the Indian
camp, when the vigor of the hunt had relaxed
somewhat, and, starting in the direction of Lexington,
kept going all night; for, as he was confident
the Shawanoes would take his trail at daylight, it
was important that he should make all progress
while the opportunity was his.</p>

<p>His hopes rose as hour after hour passed, and he
was congratulating himself on the goodly distance
made, when to his consternation he came directly
up to the very Indian camp from which he fled
long before. He had committed that error which
people lost in the woods are so prone to commit,
that of walking in a circle instead of in a straight
line.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, Hinkston was startled, and
he did not stand long surveying the smoking camp-fires,
with the grim warriors gathered about them;
but turning once more, he re-entered the woods,
making his way with so much caution, that whatever
might happen, he was sure of not repeating
the blunder committed.</p>

<p>The night was so cloudy and dark, that he was
deprived of the compass of the hunter, the stars in
the sky, and he wet his finger and held it over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
his head. This enabled him to tell the direction
of the wind which was gently blowing, and by repeating
the act, he was enabled to pursue substantially
the same direction through the night, so that
when daylight came, he was sure of one thing, he
had placed a goodly number of miles between him
and his enemies.</p>

<p>He was so worn out that he crept close to a
fallen tree, where he slept several hours. When he
awoke he found he was surrounded by a dense fog,
which shut out objects a dozen feet distant. The
moisture was dripping from the leaves, and the day
was as dismal as can be imagined; but such
weather served to help conceal his trail, and he
was hopeful that none of the keen-eyed Indians
would succeed in tracing him to his resting-place.</p>

<p>But the Shawanoes were prosecuting a most vigorous
search, and he stepped along with the greatest
care, glancing to the right and left, expecting every
minute to see some brawny warrior suddenly spring
out of the fog upon him.</p>

<p>On the right he would hear the call of a turkey,
answered a moment by another on the left, followed
perhaps by a general chorus from all points
of the compass.</p>

<p>Those wild turkeys were Indians signaling to
each other, and they frequently approached so
close, that more than once Hinkston felt it impossible
to break through the fiery ring that was
closing about him.</p>

<p>Sometimes the pursuers varied their signals by
imitating the howling of wolves, or the bleating of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
fawns, and they were often so close that discovery
would have been inevitable but for the London-like
vapor which enveloped the trembling fugitive.</p>

<p>But good fortune waited on Captain Hinkston,
and he finally extricated himself from the perilous
vicinity and reached Lexington without harm.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Colonel Clark's Invasion of the Indian Country&mdash;Boone is Promoted
to the Rank of Colonel&mdash;His Brother Killed at Blue
Licks and Boone narrowly Escapes Capture&mdash;Attack upon
the Shelbyville Garrison&mdash;News of the Surrender of Cornwallis&mdash;Attack

Appears before Bryant's Station, but Withdraws.</p></blockquote>

<p>This same year 1780 was noteworthy for two
memorable incidents in the history of Kentucky.
The first was Colonel Byrd's invasion, and the
other was the retaliatory invasion of the Indian
country by the gallant Colonel Clark, and his attack
upon the Shawanoe towns.</p>

<p>The prisoners taken by the Indians at Ruddell's
Station were kept by their captors, who released
a few after the expiration of several years, but a
great many perished by the tomahawk and knife.</p>

<p>Byrd's invasion created great excitement, and
the proposed retaliatory measure of Colonel Clark
was received with enthusiasm. The brave settlers
rallied to his standard from every direction, and in
a short time he had a full thousand men under his
command.</p>

<p>Such a force, composed of such material, might
well be considered invincible, for no combination
of Indians could have been formed on the frontier
capable of checking its march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Colonel Clark, at the head, marched directly into
the Indian country, spreading devastation wherever
he went. The towns were burned and the
corn-fields laid waste&mdash;a piece of cruelty, but war is
always cruel&mdash;and by destroying their crops, the
warriors were given something else to do besides
forming expeditions against the frontier settlements.
No attempt was made to check the advance of
Colonel Clark, and his force having inflicted an
incalculable amount of injury, withdrew and disbanded.</p>

<p>Only one skirmish had taken place; that was at
an Indian village where about twenty men were
killed on each side.</p>

<p>In the same year the organization of the militia
of Kentucky was perfected. Colonel Clark was
appointed brigadier-general and commander-in-chief
of all the militia. Major Daniel Boone was
advanced to the rank of colonel, and with Pope
and Trigg held second rank, Floyd, Logan and
Todd holding first.</p>

<p>A singular fatality seemed to attach itself to
Blue Licks, already the scene of several disasters
to the whites. In October, 1780, Boone and his
brother visited the place, and had scarcely reached
it when they were fired upon by a number of Indians
in ambush, and the brother fell dead.</p>

<p>Boone himself dashed into the woods and fled
for life, the Indians pursuing with the help of a
dog. The latter clung so close to the heels of the
fugitive, that, when he got a safe distance, he
turned about and shot him, then resuming his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
flight, he soon placed himself beyond all danger
from the savages.</p>

<p>In March, 1781, a number of straggling Indians
entered Jefferson county at different points, and
hiding along the paths, treacherously shot down
several settlers. This served as a reminder to the
pioneers that it was too soon to count upon any
degree of safety from the red men.</p>

<p>In fact there was a state of continual unrest along
the border. Among those killed in the manner
mentioned, was Colonel William Linn. Captain
Whitaker, with the resolve to punish the assassins,
started in hot pursuit of them.</p>

<p>Striking their trail, he followed it rapidly to the
Ohio, where he entered several canoes purposing
to cross and continue the pursuit. He supposed
that the warriors had already gone over, but such
was not the case, the Indians being concealed on
the Kentucky shore.</p>

<p>Just as Captain Whitaker and his men were
pushing off, the savages fired, killing and wounding
nine of them, but the others turned with such
fierceness, that the Indians were put to flight,
several of their number being left dead.</p>

<p>In the succeeding month a small station near
Shelbyville, which had been founded by Boone,
became so alarmed that the settlers determined to
remove to Bear's Creek. While engaged in doing
so, they were attacked by Indians and many
killed.</p>

<p>Colonel Floyd hastily gathered twenty-five men
and started in pursuit, but he was ambushed, half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
his party killed, and he himself would have been
tomahawked, but for the assistance of the noted
scout, Captain Wells, who helped him off the ground.</p>

<p>Toward the close of 1781, news reached Kentucky
that Lord Cornwallis had surrendered at
Yorktown, that the war was ended, and the Independence
of the American colonies secured forever.
It is impossible to imagine the delight
which thrilled the country at this joyful tidings.
America now took her place among the nations,
and began that career of progress, advancement
and civilization which has made her people the
foremost of the world.</p>

<p>The settlers along the frontier believed their day
of security and safety had come at last, and that
now they might give their whole attention to the
development of the country.</p>

<p>But the hope was an unsubstantial one. The
American Indians, as a rule, are as regardless of
treaties as are we, and they showed no disposition
to recognize the fact that the war was over and the
dawn of universal peace had come.</p>

<p>In May, 1782, twenty-five Wyandots suddenly
appeared in front of Estill's Station, and after
killing one man, and taking a prisoner, retreated.
Captain Estill, with an equal force, started in pursuit,
and overtook them at Hinkston's, where he
savagely attacked them. His lieutenant, Miller,
showed the white feather, failed to carry out instructions,
and Captain Estill and nine of his men
were killed and scalped, the Indians also losing
their leader and half their warriors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Simon Girty the renegade figures as an actor in
the darkest deeds in the history of the West. He
was a soldier at the fierce battle of Point Pleasant,
but was so maltreated by his Commander, General
Lewis, after the battle, that he forswore his race,
and became one of the leaders of the Indians and
the most merciless enemy of the settlers.</p>

<p>In the month of August, a runner arrived at
Bryant's Station with news that Girty, at the head
of a large force of Indians, was pushing through the
woods with the intention of capturing the station.
Immediate preparations were made to receive
them, and when the Indians appeared, on the 14th
of August, everything possible had been done to
put the place in the best form of defence.</p>

<p>Girty was at their head, as had been announced,
and he at once advanced to the clearing and summoned
the settlers to surrender, telling them that
no other course was left, for, besides the large force
under him he had a number of re-enforcements
marching to join him with artillery.</p>

<p>The sound of the last word was alarming to most
of the settlers, but Reynolds, one of their number,
took upon himself to answer Girty, who had
assured them of honorable treatment in case of
capitulation, and the tomahawk in the event of
their failure to accept the terms.</p>

<p>The answer of Reynolds to this demand was of
the most insulting nature. He laughed at the
threats of Girty and challenged him to make them
good; he said he was the owner of one of the
mangiest and most worthless curs ever seen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
that he put the last crowning disgrace upon the
poor dog by naming him "Girty;" that if he had
military artillery or re-enforcements, he was invited
to exhibit them, and that, finally, if Girty remained
two hours longer before the fort, they would go
out and scalp him and all the warriors he had with
him.</p>

<p>This was an emphatic reply to the question, and
Girty expressed in turn his regret that the settlers
were so blind to the fate of themselves and those
dependent upon them; but he had given them fair
warning, and their blood must be on their own
heads.</p>

<p>They had deliberately chosen to disregard the
proffer of peace and safety, and the world could
not blame him now for carrying out his threat&mdash;that
of putting every one to death with the tomahawk.</p>

<p>The resistance which they had determined to
offer would only excite the Indians to the highest
point of fury, and they would now be irrestrainable.</p>

<p>Thereupon Simon Girty went back to where his
Indian allies were awaiting him, placed himself at
their head, and then deliberately turned about and
marched away, without firing a shot at the station!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Arrival of Boone with Re-enforcements&mdash;Pursuit of the Indian
Force&mdash;Boone's Counsel Disregarded&mdash;A Frightful Disaster&mdash;Reynold's
Noble and Heroic Act&mdash;His Escape.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the morning succeeding the departure of
Girty and his Indians from the front of Bryant's
Station, Boone reached the place with re-enforcements,
among them being his son Israel and his
brother Samuel. Before the day closed, Colonel
Trigg came in from Harrodstown, and Colonel
Todd from Lexington, each with a similar force, so
that the retreat of the noted renegade was the best
thing that could have taken place for his own personal
safety.</p>

<p>The company that gathered within the station
was a curious one&mdash;numbering about two hundred,
one-fourth of whom were commissioned officers.
A noisy consultation was held, and amid much uproar
and wrangling, it was resolved to pursue the
Indians at once, without awaiting the arrival of
Colonel Logan, who was known to be approaching
with a large force, and was certain to arrive within
the succeeding twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Accordingly the pursuit was begun without
delay, and it proved most easy to keep up, for the
retreat of Girty and his Indians was marked by
such a broad and plain trail that there could be no
mistaking it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
The bushes had been bent down, the bark was
hacked off the trees with tomahawks, and articles
were strewn along the way with most remarkable
prodigality.</p>

<p>Indeed there was so much pains taken to show
the trail that Boone and his older companions
were alarmed. They believed Girty had caused it
to be done for the very purpose of drawing them
in pursuit, and Boone spoke to many of the officers.
But they laughed at his fears and pressed forward
with the ardor of Kentuckians who see the certainty
of a fierce struggle close at hand, where the
victory is likely to be on their side.</p>

<p>When the settlers reached Blue Licks&mdash;an ominous
name for them&mdash;they discovered several Indians
on the other side of the Licking, who leisurely
retreated into the woods, without showing any
special alarm over the pursuit of the Kentuckians.</p>

<p>As it was certain that Girty and his whole force
were immediately in front, another consultation
was held; for the pursuers began to feel the need
of care and caution in their movements. After a
long discussion, all turned to Boone, who they felt
was the best qualified to advise them in the emergency.</p>

<p>The grave face and manner of the great pioneer
showed that he appreciated the danger.</p>

<p>"Our situation is a critical one," said he; "you
know nothing of the nature of the country on the
other side of the Licking, and the Indians have
acted in such a manner that I'm satisfied they
have laid an ambush for us. In my opinion, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
have the choice of two courses: the first is to
divide our men and send one half up the river to
cross it at the Rapids and attack in the rear, while
the rest make a simultaneous assault in front. But
the other course and the one which I most earnestly
urge is to await the coming of Colonel Logan and
his re-enforcements. We have a strong body in
front of us, and we have been taught more than
one lesson by the disasters of the past few years,
which we cannot afford to forget to-day. At any
rate, we ought not to try to cross the river until we
have sent forward spies to learn the number and
disposition of the troops."</p>

<p>These were the words of wisdom and prudence,
but they fell upon unwilling ears, and the majority
bitterly opposed the advice of the old pioneer.
They insisted that the Indians were fleeing in
alarm, and that such delay would give them time
to get away unscathed, while the proposal to
divide the settlers would so weaken them that the
Indians would fall upon the detachments separately
and destroy them. It may be said there was
reason in the last objection, but none in the
former.</p>

<p>It is probable there was little discipline in this
wrangling assemblage which was engaged in discussing
a most momentous question, for while the
arguments were going on, Major McGary sprang
upon his horse, spurred him at full gallop toward
the river, calling upon all those who were not
cowards to follow him.</p>

<p>The next instant he was plunging through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
stream, and the whole shouting rabble rushed
tumultuously after him. There was no semblance
of order as they shouted, struggled, and hurried
pell-mell to their doom. Simon Girty, the renegade,
from the woods on the other side, must have
smiled grimly, as he saw his victims doing everything
in their power to hasten their own destruction,
just as the majority of the expeditions against
the Indians did before and have done since.</p>

<p>The soldiers hastened forward, until they reached
the point against which Boone had warned them&mdash;the
heading of two ravines. They had scarcely
halted, when a party of Indians appeared and
opened fire upon them. McGary returned the fire,
but his position was disadvantageous, being on
an exposed ridge, while, as usual, the Shawanoes
were in a ravine with plenty of opportunity to conceal
themselves, while picking off the whites.</p>

<p>The majority of the settlers had not yet come
up, but they were hurrying forward in the same
wild disorder, and continued rushing up the ridge,
in time to meet the fire from the Indians which
grew hotter and more destructive every minute.</p>

<p>Although placed at such disadvantage, the whites
fought with great bravery, loading and shooting
rapidly, though without any attempt at discipline
and regularity. The fact was, the whites saw they
were entrapped, and each and all were fighting for
their very lives.</p>

<p>Had the warriors been given their choice of
ground, they would have selected in all probability
that taken by the respective combatants, for nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
could have been more in favor of Girty and his
savages.</p>

<p>The Indians gradually closed in around the
whites, loading and firing with great rapidity,
while the settlers fell fast before the bullets rained
in upon them from every quarter.</p>

<p>Among the officers, Todd, Trigg, Harland and
McBride were soon killed, and Daniel Boone's son
Israel, while gallantly doing his duty, fell pierced
by bullets. The savages gaining confidence from
their success continued to extend their line, so as
to turn the right of the Kentuckians, until they
got in their rear and cut off their retreat to the
river.</p>

<p>The soldiers saw what the Indians were doing,
for the heavy fire indicated it, and they became
panic-stricken. At once every one thought of
saving only himself, and a tumultuous, headlong
rush was made for the river. As a matter of
course, the savages did not allow the invitation to
pass unaccepted, and they swarmed down upon
the demoralized whites, tomahawking them without
mercy.</p>

<p>Most of the horsemen escaped, but the slaughter
of the foot soldiers was terrible. Nearly all of
those who were in Major McGary's party were
killed, and at the river the scene became appalling.
Horsemen, foot soldiers, and painted Indians were
mingled in fierce confusion, fighting desperately in
the water, which was crowded from shore to shore.</p>

<p>A score of soldiers, having got across, halted and
poured a volley into the red men, which checked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
them for a few minutes; but they quickly rallied
and resumed the massacre and pursuit, the latter
continuing for fully twenty miles. More than
sixty Kentuckians were killed, a number made
prisoners; and another disaster was added to the
long roll of those which mark the history of the
attempts at civilization in the West.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone bore himself in this fight with his
usual intrepidity and coolness, doing his utmost to
check the hurricane-like rush of the Indians, and
endeavoring to rally those around him into something
like organized resistance. Could this have
been done, the renegade Girty and his merciless
horde would have been routed, for some of those
who fought on his side admitted years afterward
that they were once on the very point of breaking
and fleeing in disorder.</p>

<p>But Boone saw his son and many of his closest
friends shot dead, and himself almost surrounded
by Indians, before he comprehended his imminent
personal peril.</p>

<p>The ford which was looked upon by most of the
settlers as the only door of escape was crowded
with fugitives, and several hundred warriors were
between him and the river. Instead of seeking
to reach the stream, he turned toward the ravine
from which the Shawanoes themselves had emerged,
and, with several comrades, made a desperate dash
for it.</p>

<p>There was firing all along the line at the few who
took this exceptional means, and several small parties
sprang after them. Boone and his companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
were fleet of foot, but he succeeded in eluding their
enemies more by strategy than speed, and finally
brought his friends to the river bank at a point so
far below the ford that they were invisible to the
Indians.</p>

<p>Here they swam across and then started for
Bryant's Station, which they reached without further
molestation.</p>

<p>Such an utter rout and irretrievable disaster is
always marked by some extraordinary incidents.
Reynolds, who made the insulting reply to Simon
Girty, when he demanded the surrender of Bryant's
Station, was in the battle and fought furiously
against the renegade and his allies, but was forced
back by the turbulent tide which, once set in
motion, swept everything before it.</p>

<p>Reynolds was making for the river, when he
overtook an officer on foot who was so weak from
wounds received in a former engagement with the
Indians, that he could not keep up with the fugitives,
and, indeed, was so exhausted, that he was
ready to fall fainting to the ground.</p>

<p>Reynolds sprang from his horse and helped the
officer upon it, and then told him to do the best
he could. The captain did so and saved himself.</p>

<p>Reynolds was now placed in great peril, but he
made a plunge into the river, and soon carried himself
by powerful strokes to the other side, where
he was immediately made prisoner.</p>

<p>The Shawanoes, at this juncture, were so engaged
in capturing and killing the fugitives, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
they could not leave very large guards to keep
those who fell into their hands.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the guard placed over
Reynolds was a single Indian, but he was tall and
muscular, and would have preferred to tomahawk
his prisoner and join in the general massacre.</p>

<p>Reynolds did not give him time to debate the
matter, but, turning quickly upon the warrior, dealt
him a blow which felled him like an ox, and then,
before he could rise, Reynolds was in the woods,
speeding for life.</p>

<p>One of the first men whom he encountered,
after reaching the settlement, was the officer to
whom he had given his horse, when there was no
other means by which he could be saved.</p>

<p>The officer appreciated the favor, and showed it
by making Reynolds a present of two hundred
acres of land.</p>

<p>Kentucky now approached an eventful period
in her history. As we have stated, the career of
Daniel Boone is woven in the very warp and woof
of the narrative of the early days of the West, and
in order to reach a proper understanding of the life
and character of the great pioneer, it is necessary
to carry the two along together.</p>

<p>The defeat and massacre at Blue Licks excited a
profound shock and indignation along the frontier,
and the feeling was general that necessity demanded
the chastisement of the Indians, who
would be likely otherwise to continue their depredations.</p>

<p>The gallant and clear-headed officer, General
George Rogers Clark, the "Hannibal of the West,"
issued a call for volunteers to assemble at Bryant's
Station. The General was so popular, and the confidence
in him so universal, that hundreds flocked
to the rendezvous, where, in a brief time, he placed
himself at the head of one of the most formidable
forces ever raised in that portion of the country
during its early days.</p>

<p>The Indians were too wise to meet this army in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
anything like open battle. They carefully kept
out of its way, expending their energies in picking
off stragglers, and occasionally sending in a stray
shot from some point, from which they could flee before
it could be reached by the infuriated soldiers.</p>

<p>General Clark pushed forward, burned several
Indian towns, and laid waste many fields. A few
prisoners were taken, and a few killed, when the
expedition returned and disbanded.</p>

<p>This was the only enterprise of the kind that
was set on foot by Kentucky during the year 1782,
which, however, was marked by one of the darkest
deeds on the part of white men, which blacken the
pages of our history.</p>

<p>On the 8th of March, Colonel Daniel Williamson,
with a body of men, marched to the Moravian
town of Gnadenhutten, where he obtained possession
of the arms of the Christian Indians through
treachery, and then massacred one hundred of
them in as cruel and atrocious manner as that
shown by Nana Sahib at Cawnpore. The harvest
of such an appalling crime was rapine and death
along the frontier, as it has been demonstrated
many a time since.</p>

<p>These outrages became so numerous that Colonel
William Crawford organized an expedition in Western
Pennsylvania, numbering 450 men, with which
he started against the Wyandot towns on the Sandusky.</p>

<p>His force in fact was nothing but an undisciplined
rabble, and no one could predict anything
but disaster, when it should penetrate the Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
country. It was this lack of discipline that had
given the death-blow to so many expeditions
against the tribes on the frontier, and which is the
strongest ally an enemy can have.</p>

<p>Early in June, Colonel Crawford's force reached
the plains of Sandusky, straggling along like the
remnants of a defeated army, and so mutinous that
numbers were continually straying back, deserting
openly and caring nothing for the wishes or commands
of their leader.</p>

<p>Colonel Crawford saw that a crisis was approaching,
and calling a council, it was agreed that if a
large force of Indians was not encountered within
the succeeding twenty-four hours, they would withdraw
altogether from the country.</p>

<p>A thousandfold better would it have been had
they done so at once.</p>

<p>Within the succeeding hour, scouts came in
with the news that a large body of savages were
marching against them, and at that moment were
almost within rifle-shot.</p>

<p>The proximity of danger impressed itself upon
the soldiers and officers, who made hurried preparations
to receive the warriors that appeared
shortly after, swarming through and filling the
woods by the hundred.</p>

<p>The whites were eager for battle and they
opened upon them at once, keeping up a hot galling
fire until dark, when the Indians drew off. The
soldiers slept on their arms.</p>

<p>At daylight the fight was renewed, but it assumed
the nature of a skirmish more than that of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
regular battle. The Indians had suffered severely,
and they were more careful of exposing themselves.
They took advantage of the trees and bushes,
firing rapidly and doing considerable damage.</p>

<p>But the soldiers were accustomed to such warfare,
and they not only held their own ground, but
maintained a destructive, though desultory fire
which was more effective than that of the enemy.</p>

<p>The most alarming fact was that the Indians
were not only waiting for re-enforcements but were
receiving them all through the day. The spies of
Colonel Crawford reported that other warriors were
continually coming in, it being evident that runners
had been sent out by the chiefs to summon all the
help they could command.</p>

<p>This caused a great deal of uneasiness on the
part of the whites, who saw the probability of an
overwhelming force gathering in front of them, with
the awful sequel of massacre, which had marked
so many expeditions into the Indian country.</p>

<p>At sunset, when the second day's battle ceased,
an anxious consultation was held by the officers of
Crawford's command, at which the momentous
question was discussed as to what was to be done.</p>

<p>The conviction was so general that they would
be attacked by a resistless force, if they remained
on the ground another day, that it was agreed to
retreat during the night. As the savage force was
already very large and was hourly increasing, it will
be understood a withdrawal could only be accomplished
by the utmost secrecy, and amid the most
profound silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
It was decided, therefore, that the march should
begin at midnight, in perfect silence, and preparations
were made to carry out the decision of the
council of officers.</p>

<p>At a late hour the troops were arranged in good
order, and the retreat was begun. A few minutes
after, some confusion and the firing of guns were
noticed in the rear and threatened a panic, but the
soldiers were speedily quieted, and the withdrawal
resumed in an orderly manner.</p>

<p>Probably it would have been continued as intended,
but, at the critical moment, some terrified
soldier called out that the Indians had discovered
what they were doing and were coming down upon
them in full force.</p>

<p>The retreat at once became a rout, every man
feeling that scarcely a hope of escape remained.
The cavalry broke and scattered in the woods, and
the desperate efforts of Colonel Crawford, who
galloped back and forth, shouting and seeking to
encourage them to stand firm, were thrown away.</p>

<p>As if it was decreed that nothing should be lacking
in this grotesque tragedy, the men shouted
and yelled like crazy persons, so that the impression
went to the astounded Indians that "the
white men had routed themselves and they had
nothing to do but to pick up the stragglers."</p>

<p>The sequel can be imagined. The warriors
sprang to the pursuit and kept it up with the ferocious
tenacity of blood-hounds, all through the
night and into the succeeding day. The massacre
went on hour after hour, until over a hundred of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
the soldiers had been killed or captured, and still
another frightful disaster was added to those which
already marked the history of the development of
the West.</p>

<p>Among the prisoners captured were two&mdash;Dr.
Knight, the surgeon of the company, and Colonel
Crawford himself.</p>

<p>Dr. Knight and the Colonel were taken at the
close of the second day, the latter having incurred
unusual danger from his anxiety respecting the
fate of his son. Their captors were a small party
of Delawares, who carried them to the old Wyandot
town. Just before reaching it, a halt was made,
and the celebrated chief, Captain Pipe, painted
Dr. Knight and Colonel Crawford black. This
meant they had already been doomed to death by
being burned at the stake!</p>

<p>Their immediate experience did not tend to
lessen their terrors. As they moved along, they
continually passed bodies of their friends that had
been frightfully mangled by their captors, who
were evidently determined that the massacre of
the Christian Indians should be fully avenged.</p>

<p>When near the Indian town, they overtook five
prisoners who were surrounded by a mob that
were tormenting them by beating and taunting.
Suddenly the Indians sprang upon them with a
yell, and every one was tomahawked. Colonel
Crawford was turned over to a Shawanoe doctor,
and Surgeon Knight went along with them.</p>

<p>A few minutes previous, Simon Girty, the renegade,
rode up beside them and became more fiendish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
in his taunts than the Indians. He had been
acquainted with Colonel Crawford years before,
and had special cause for enmity, because the
Colonel had used his efforts to defeat Girty for
some military office he was eager to obtain.</p>

<p>He now commented upon their appearance
(being painted black and of course in great distress
of mind), and he assured them that their death at
the stake was one of the certainties of the immediate
future. He laughed and swore and was in
high spirits, as well he might be; for, inspired as
he was by the most rancorous hatred of his own
race, he had been gratified that day by assisting in
one of the most dreadful disasters to the settlers
that had ever occurred on the frontier.</p>

<p>When the village was reached, Colonel Crawford
seized a forlorn hope of escaping by appealing to a
Shawanoe chief named Wingenund, who had frequently
visited his house, and between whom quite
a strong friendship existed.</p>

<p>When the chief learned that Colonel Crawford
was painted black, he knew that nothing could
save him, and he withdrew to his own lodge that
he might not witness his sufferings; but Crawford
sent for him, and the chief could not refuse to go
to his friend.</p>

<p>Their meeting was quite affecting, the chief
showing some embarrassment and pretending to be
uncertain of the identity of the prisoner, through
his paint.</p>

<p>"You are Colonel Crawford, I believe."</p>

<p>"Yes, Wingenund, you must remember me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
"Yes, I have not forgotten you; we have often
drank and eaten together, and you have been kind
to me many times."</p>

<p>"I hope that friendship remains, Wingenund."</p>

<p>"It would remain forever, if you were in any
place but this, and were what you ought to be."</p>

<p>"I have been engaged only in honorable warfare,
and when we take your warriors prisoners we treat
them right."</p>

<p>The chief looked meaningly at the poor captive
and said,</p>

<p>"I would do the most I can for you, and I
might do something, had you not joined Colonel
Williamson, who murdered the Moravian Indians,
knowing they were innocent of all wrong and that
he ran no risk in killing them with their squaws and
children."</p>

<p>"That was a bad act&mdash;a very bad act, Wingenund,
and had I been with him, I never would have
permitted it. I abhor the deed as do all good
white men, no matter where they are."</p>

<p>"That may all be true," said the chief, "but
Colonel Williamson went a second time and killed
more of the Moravians."</p>

<p>"But I went out and did all I could to stop
him."</p>

<p>"That may be true, too, but you cannot make
the Indians believe it, and then, Colonel Crawford,
when you were on the march here, you turned
aside with your soldiers and went to the Moravian
towns, but found them deserted. Our spies were
watching you and saw you do this. Had you been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
looking for warriors, you would not have gone
there, for you know the Moravians are foolish and
will not fight."</p>

<p>"We have done nothing, and your spies saw
nothing that your own people would not have done
had they been in our situation."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to see you die, though you
have forfeited your life, and had we Colonel Williamson,
we might spare you; but that man has
taken good care to keep out of our reach, and you
will have to take his place. I can do nothing for
you."</p>

<p>Colonel Crawford begged the chief to try and
save him from the impending fate, but Wingenund
assured him it was useless, and took his departure.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward the Indians began their preparations
for the frightful execution.</p>

<p>A large stake was driven into the ground, and
wood carefully placed around it. Then Crawford's
hands were tied behind his back, and he was led
out and securely fastened to the stake.</p>

<p>At this time, Simon Girty was sitting on his
horse near by, taking no part in the proceedings,
but showing by his looks and manner that he
enjoyed them fully as much as did the executioners
themselves.</p>

<p>Happening to catch the eye of the renegade,
Colonel Crawford asked him whether the Indians
really intended to burn him at the stake. Girty
answered with a laugh that there could be no
doubt of it, and Crawford said no more. He knew
that it was useless to appeal to him who was of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
his own race, for his heart was blacker and more
merciless than those of the savages who were
kindling the fagots at his feet.</p>

<p>The particulars of the burning of Colonel Crawford
have been given by Dr. Knight, his comrade,
who succeeded in escaping, when he, too, had been
condemned to the same fate. These particulars
are too frightful to present in full, for they could
only horrify the reader.</p>

<p>Colonel Crawford was subjected to the most
dreadful form of torture, the fire burning slowly,
while the Indians amused themselves by firing
charges of powder into his body. He bore it for a
long time with fortitude, but finally ran round and
round the stake, when his thongs were burned in
two, in the instinctive effort to escape his tormentors.</p>

<p>The squaws were among the most fiendish of the
tormentors, until the miserable captive was driven
so frantic by his sufferings that he appealed to Girty
to shoot him and thus end his awful sufferings.</p>

<p>This dying request was refused, and at the end
of two hours nature gave out and the poor Colonel
died.</p>

<p>Simon Girty assured Dr. Knight that a similar
fate was awaiting him, and Knight himself had
little hope of its being averted. A son of Colonel
Crawford was subjected to the same torture, but,
as we have stated, Dr. Knight effected his escape
shortly afterward.</p>

<p>Simon Girty, the most notorious renegade of the
West, remained with the Indians until his death.
He became a great drunkard, but took part in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
defeat and massacre of St. Clair's army in 1791,
and was at the battle of the Fallen Timbers, three
years later. Fearful of returning to his own kindred
at the end of hostilities, he went to Canada,
where he became something of a trader, until the
breaking out of the war of 1812, when he once
more joined the Indians and was killed at the battle
of the Thames.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Adventure of the Spies White and M'Clelland&mdash;Daring Defence
of her Home by Mrs. Merrill&mdash;Exploits of Kennan the Ranger.</p></blockquote>

<p>The block-house garrison at the mouth of Hocking
River was thrown into considerable alarm on
one occasion by the discovery that an unusual
number of Indians were swarming in their town in
the valley. Such a state of affairs, as a rule, means
that the savages are making, or have made, preparations
for a serious movement against the whites.</p>

<p>To ascertain the cause of the presence of so many
warriors in that section, two of the most skillful and
daring rangers of the West were sent out to spy their
movements. These scouts were White and McClelland,
and the season on which they ventured upon
their dangerous expedition was one of the balmy
days in Indian summer.</p>

<p>The scouts made their way leisurely to the top of
the well-known prominence near Lancaster, Ohio,
from whose rocky summit they looked off over the
plain spreading far to the west, and through which
the Hocking River winds like a stream of silver.</p>

<p>From this elevation, the keen-eyed scouts gazed
down upon a curious picture&mdash;one which told them
of the certain coming of the greatest danger which
can break upon the frontier settlement. What
they saw, and the singular adventures that befell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
them, are told by the Reverend J.&nbsp;B. Finley, the
well-known missionary of the West.</p>

<p>Day by day the spies witnessed the horse-racing of
the assembled thousands. The old sachems looked
on with their Indian indifference, the squaws engaged
in their usual drudgery, while the children
indulged unrestrainedly in their playful gambols.
The arrival of a new war party was greeted with
loud shouts, which, striking the stony face of Mount
Pleasant, were driven back in the various indentations
of the surrounding hills, producing reverberations
and echoes as if so many fiends were gathered
in universal levee. On several occasions, small
parties left the prairie and ascended the mount
from its low and grassy eastern slope. At such
times, the spies would hide in the deep fissures of
the rocks on the west, and again leave their hiding-places
when their unwelcome visitors had disappeared.
For food, they depended on jerked venison
and corn-bread, with which their knapsacks
were well stored. They dare not kindle a fire, and
the report of one of their rifles would have brought
upon them the entire force of Indians. For drink,
they resorted to the rain-water which still stood in
the hollows of the rocks; but, in a short time, this
source was exhausted, and McClelland and White
were forced to abandon their enterprise, or find a
new supply. To accomplish this, M'Clelland, being
the oldest, resolved to make the attempt. With his
trusty rifle in hand and two canteens slung over his
shoulders, he cautiously descended, by a circuitous
route, to the prairie skirting the hills on the north.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Under cover of the hazel thicket, he reached the
river, and turning the bold point of a hill, found a
beautiful spring within a few feet of the stream
now known by the name of Cold Spring. Filling
his canteens, he returned in safety to his watchful
companion. It was now determined to have a fresh
supply of water every day, and the duty was performed
alternately.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions, after White had filled
his canteens, he sat watching the water as it came
gurgling out of the earth, when the light sound of
footsteps fell on his ear. Upon turning around he
saw two squaws within a few feet of him. The
eldest gave one of those far-reaching whoops peculiar
to Indians.</p>

<p>White at once comprehended his perilous situation.
If the alarm should reach the camps or town,
he and his companion must inevitably perish. Self-preservation
compelled him to inflict a noiseless
death on the squaws, and in such a manner as,
if possible, to leave no trace behind. Ever rapid in
thought and prompt in action, he sprang upon his
victims with the rapidity and power of the lion, and
grasping the throat of each, sprang into the river.
He thrust the head of the eldest under the water,
and while making strong efforts to submerge the
younger (who, however, powerfully resisted him),
to his astonishment, she addressed him in his own
language, though in almost inarticulate sounds.
Releasing his hold, she informed him she had been
a prisoner ten years, and was taken from below
Wheeling; that the Indians had killed all the family;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
that her brother and herself were taken prisoners,
but he succeeded, on the second night, in making his
escape. During this narrative, White had drowned
the elder squaw, and had let the body float off down
the current, where it was not likely soon to be found.
He now directed the girl to follow him, and, with
his usual speed and energy, pushed for the mount.</p>

<p>They had scarcely gone half way, when they
heard the alarm-cry, some quarter of a mile down
the stream. It was supposed some party of Indians,
returning from hunting, struck the river just
as the body of the squaw floated past. White and
the girl succeeded in reaching the mount, where
M'Clelland had been no indifferent spectator to the
sudden commotion among the Indians. Parties of
warriors were seen immediately to strike off in every
direction, and White and the girl had scarcely
arrived before a company of some twenty warriors
had reached the eastern slope of the mount, and
were cautiously and carefully keeping under cover.
Soon the spies saw their foes, as they glided from
tree to tree and rock to rock, till their position was
surrounded, except on the west perpendicular side,
and all hope of escape was cut off. In this perilous
position, nothing was left but to sell their lives as
dearly as possible.</p>

<p>This they resolved to do, and advised the girl to
escape to the Indians and tell them she had been
taken prisoner. She said, "No! Death in the presence
of my own people is a thousand times better
than captivity and slavery. Furnish me with a gun,
and I will show I know how to die. This place I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
not leave. Here my bones shall lie bleaching with
yours, and, should either of you escape, you will
carry the tidings of my death to my few relatives."</p>

<p>Remonstrance proved fruitless. The two spies
quickly matured their means of defence, and vigorously
commenced the attack from the front, where,
from the very narrow backbone of the mount, the
savages had to advance in single file, and without
any covert. Beyond this neck, the warriors availed
themselves of the rocks and trees in advancing,
but, in passing from one to the other, they must be
exposed for a short time, and a moment's exposure
of their swarthy forms was enough for the unerring
rifles of the spies. The Indians, being entirely
ignorant of how many were in ambuscade, grew
very cautious as they advanced.</p>

<p>After bravely maintaining the fight in front, and
keeping the enemy in check, the scouts discovered
a new danger threatening them. The foe made
preparation to attack them on the flank, which
could be most successfully done by reaching an isolated
rock, lying in one of the projections on the
southern hill-side. This rock once gained by the
Indians, they could bring the whites under point-blank
range without the possibility of escape. The
spies saw the hopelessness of their situation, which
it appeared nothing could change.</p>

<p>With this impending fate resting over them,
they continued calm and calculating, and as unwearied
as the strongest desire of life could produce.
Soon M'Clelland saw a tall, swarthy figure
preparing to spring from a covert, so near to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
fatal rock that a bound or two would reach it, and
all hope of life would then be gone. He felt that
everything depended on one single advantageous
shot; and, although but an inch or two of the warrior's
body was exposed, and that at the distance
of eighty or a hundred yards, he resolved to fire.</p>

<p>Coolly raising his rifle, shading the sight with his
hand, he drew a bead so sure that he felt conscious
it would do the deed. He touched the trigger with
his finger; the hammer came down, but, in place
of striking fire, it broke his flint into many pieces!
He now felt sure that the Indian must reach the
rock before he could adjust another flint, yet he
proceeded to the task with the utmost composure.
Casting his eye toward the fearful point, suddenly
he saw the warrior stretch every muscle for the
leap, and with the agility of a panther he made
the spring, but, instead of reaching the rock, he
uttered a yell and his dark body fell, rolling down
the steep to the valley below.</p>

<p>Some unknown hand had slain him, and a hundred
voices from the valley below echoed his death
cry. The warrior killed, it was evident, was a
prominent one of the tribe, and there was great
disappointment over the failure of the movement,
which, it was considered, would seal the doom of
the daring scouts.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes passed, when a second warrior
was seen stealthily advancing to the covert, which
had cost the other Indian his life in attempting to
reach. At the same moment the attack in front
was renewed with great fierceness, so as to require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
the constant loading and firing of the spies to prevent
their foes from gaining the eminence. Still
the whites kept continually glancing at the warrior,
who seemed assured of the coveted position.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gathered his muscles and made the
spring. His body was seen to bound outward, but
instead of reaching the shelf, for which it started,
it gathered itself like a ball and rolled down the
hill after his predecessor.</p>

<p>The unknown friend had fired a second shot!</p>

<p>This caused consternation among the Shawanoes,
and brave as they unquestionably were, there was
no one else who tried to do that which had cost
the others their lives. Feeling that they had no
ordinary foe to combat on the hill, the savages
withdrew a short distance to consult over some
new method of attack.</p>

<p>The respite came most opportunely to the spies,
who had been fighting and watching for hours and
needed the rest.</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to M'Clelland that the girl
was not with them, and they concluded that she
had fled through terror and most probably had
fallen into the hands of the Indians again, or what
was equally probable, she had been killed during
the fight.</p>

<p>But the conclusion was scarcely formed, when she
was seen to come from behind a rock, with a smoking
rifle in her hand. Rejoining the astonished and
delighted spies, she quickly explained that she was
the unsuspected friend who shot the two warriors
when in the very act of leaping to the point from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
which they expected to command the position of
the defenders.</p>

<p>While the fight was at its height, she saw a warrior
advance some distance beyond the others,
when a rifle-ball from the scouts stretched him
lifeless. Without being seen, the girl ran quickly
out to where he lay and possessed herself of his
gun and ammunition.</p>

<p>Subsequent events showed what good use she
made of the weapon. Her life among the Indians
taught her to see on the instant the point which
the warriors would strive to secure, and, which secured,
would place the spies at their mercy. She
crawled under some brush, and carefully loading
the rifle, held it ready for the critical moment.</p>

<p>It was a singular coincidence, in which the girl
must have perceived the hand of Providence, that
the second warrior who advanced to the spot was
recognized by her as the identical wretch who led
the company which killed nearly all her family and
who carried her away a prisoner. She made sure,
when she pulled trigger upon him, that the bullet
should go straight to the mark!</p>

<p>M'Clelland and White appreciated the value of
the ally who had joined them, for, without those
well-aimed shots of hers, the two must have fallen
before the rifles of the Shawanoes. They congratulated
her on her nerve and skill, and assured her,
that her achievements alone had placed them in a
position in which they could feel there was some
hope of escape.</p>

<p>As night approached, dark and tumultuous clouds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
rolled up from the horizon, and overspreading the
skies rendered the night like that of Egypt. As
the spies felt that their withdrawal from the dangerous
spot must be effected, if effected at all, before
the rise of the morning's sun, they saw how
much the inky blackness of sky and earth was likely
to embarrass them.</p>

<p>However, as the girl was intimately acquainted
with the topography of the country immediately
surrounding them, it was decided that she should
take the lead, the others following close after her.</p>

<p>The great advantage likely to accrue from such
an arrangement was that, if they encountered any
Indians, as they were more than likely to do, her
knowledge of their tongue would enable her to
deceive them. They had not gone a hundred yards
when the wisdom of this course was demonstrated.</p>

<p>A low "whist" from the guide admonished the
spies of danger, and, as agreed beforehand, they
sank flat upon their faces and waited for the signal
that all was right, before going further. Peering
cautiously through the dense gloom, they became
aware that the girl was missing, and she was gone
so long that they were filled with serious misgivings.</p>

<p>Finally her shadowy figure came out of the
gloom, and she told them she had succeeded in
having two sentinels removed whose position was
such that it would have been impossible for them
to get by undiscovered.</p>

<p>In the same noiseless manner the flight was resumed,
and the three phantoms, moved along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
through the gloom for a half hour, when they were
startled by the barking of a dog close to them.
Instantly White and M'Clelland cocked their guns,
but their guide whispered that they were now
in the very middle of the village, and their lives
depended on the utmost silence and secrecy.
They needed hardly to be assured of that, and they
signified that her directions would be followed implicitly.</p>

<p>A minute later they were accosted by a squaw
from an opening in her wigwam; the guide made
appropriate reply, in the Indian tongue, and without
pause, moved on. Her voice and manner
disarmed suspicion, and the three were not disturbed.</p>

<p>Only a short distance further was passed, when
the girl assured them they were beyond the limits
of the village, and the great danger was ended.
She had shown extraordinary wisdom and shrewdness
in leading the spies out of their great peril.
She knew the Shawanoes had their sentinels stationed
at every avenue of escape, and instead of
taking those which it would seem most natural to
follow under the circumstances, she adopted the
bold plan of disarming all these precautions by
passing directly through the center of the village.
The very boldness of the plan proved its success.</p>

<p>The fugitives now made for the Ohio River,
and, at the end of three days' hard travel, they
safely reached the block-house. Their escape prevented
the contemplated attack by the Indians, and
the adventure itself is certainly one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
remarkable of the many told of the early days of
Ohio and Kentucky.</p>

<p>Among the members of Mr. Finley's church was
a quiet, plain-looking woman who was mild, gentle,
and consistent in her talk and conversation. And
yet this Mrs. Merril was the heroine of the following
wonderful exploit:</p>

<p>In 1791, the house of Mr. Merril, in Nelson
county, was assaulted by Indians. He was fired
upon and fell wounded into the room. The savages
attempted to rush in after him, but Mrs. Merril
and her daughter succeeded in closing the door.
The assailants began to hew a passage through it
with their tomahawks; and, having made a hole
large enough, one of them attempted to squeeze
into the room. Undismayed, the courageous
woman seized an axe, gave the ruffian a fatal blow
as he sprang through, and he sunk quietly to the
floor. Another, and still another, followed till four
of their number met the same fate. The silence
within induced one of them to pause and look
through the crevice in the door. Discovering the
fate of those who had entered, the savages resolved
upon another mode of attack. Two of their number
clambered to the top of the house, and prepared
to descend the broad wooden chimney. This new
danger was promptly met. Mrs. Merril did not
desert her post; but directed her little son to cut
open the feather bed, and pour the feathers upon
the fire. This the little fellow did with excellent
effect. The two savages, scorched and suffocated,
fell down into the fire, and were soon dispatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
by the children and the wounded husband. At
that moment a fifth savage attempted to enter the
door; but he received a salute upon the head from
the axe held by Mrs. Merril, that sent him howling
away. Thus seven of the savages were destroyed
by the courage and energy of this heroic woman.
When the sole survivor reached the town, and was
asked, "What news?" a prisoner heard his reply:
"Bad news! The squaws fight worse than long
knives."</p>

<p>William Kennan, a noted scout and ranger, was
the hero of many extraordinary incidents.</p>

<p>He had long been remarkable for strength and
activity. In the course of the march from Fort
Washington, he had repeated opportunities of testing
his astonishing powers in those respects, and
was admitted to be the swiftest runner of the light
corps. On the evening preceding the action, his
corps had been advanced in front of the first line
of infantry, to give seasonable notice of the enemy's
approach.</p>

<p>As day was dawning, he observed about thirty
Indians within one hundred yards of the guard-fire,
approaching cautiously toward the spot where he
stood, in company with twenty other rangers, the
rest being considerably in the rear. Supposing it
to be a mere scouting party, and not superior in
number to the rangers, he sprang forward a few
paces in order to shelter himself in a spot of peculiarly
rank grass, and, after firing with a quick aim
at the foremost Indian, fell flat upon his face, and
proceeded with all possible rapidity to reload his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
gun, not doubting for a moment that his companions
would maintain their position and support him.</p>

<p>The Indians, however, rushed forward in such
overwhelming masses, that the rangers were compelled
to flee with precipitation, leaving young
Kennan in total ignorance of his danger. Fortunately,
the captain of his company had observed
him, when he threw himself in the grass, and suddenly
shouted aloud: "Run, Kennan, or you are
a dead man!" He instantly sprang to his feet, and
beheld the Indians within ten feet of him, while his
company were more than one hundred yards in front.</p>

<p>Not a moment was to be lost. He darted off,
with every muscle strained to the utmost, and was
pursued by a dozen of the enemy with loud yells.
He at first pressed straight forward to the usual
fording-place in the creek, which ran between the
rangers and the main army; but several Indians,
who had passed him before he arose from the grass,
threw themselves in his way and completely cut
him off from the rest.</p>

<p>By the most powerful exertions, he had thrown
the whole body of pursuers behind him, with the
exception of one young chief, probably Meeshawa,
who displayed a swiftness and perseverance equal
to his own. In the circuit which Kennan was
obliged to make, the race continued for more
than four hundred yards. The distance between
them was about eighteen feet, which Kennan could
not increase, nor his adversary diminish. Each for
the time put his whole soul in the race.</p>

<p>Kennan, as far as he was able, kept his eye upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
the motions of his pursuer, lest he should throw the
tomahawk, which he held aloft in a menacing attitude,
and, at length, finding that no other Indian
was at hand, he determined to try the mettle of
his pursuer in a different manner, and felt for his
knife in order to turn at bay. It had escaped from
its sheath, however, while he lay in the grass, and
his hair almost lifted the cap from his head when
he found himself wholly unarmed.</p>

<p>As he had slackened his space for a moment, the
Indian was almost within reach of him when he
started ahead again; but the idea of being without
arms lent wings to his flight, and for the first time he
saw himself gaining ground. He had watched the
motions of his pursuer too closely to pay proper
attention to the nature of the ground before him,
and suddenly found himself in front of a large tree,
which had been blown down, and upon which had
been heaped brush and other impediments to the
height of eight or nine feet.</p>

<p>The Indian, heretofore silent, now gave utterance
to an exultant shout, for he must have felt sure of
his victim. Not a second was given to Kennan to
deliberate. He must clear the obstacle in front or
it was all over with him. Putting his whole soul
into the effort, he bounded into the air with a
power which astonished himself, and, clearing limbs,
brush, and everything else, alighted in perfect safety
on the other side. An exclamation of amazement
burst from the band of pursuers bringing up the
rear, not one of whom had the hardihood to
attempt the same feat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Kennan, however, had no leisure to enjoy his
triumph. Dashing into the creek, where the high
banks would protect him from the fire of the
enemy, he ran up the edge of the stream until he
found a convenient crossing place, and rejoined the
rangers in the rear of the encampment, panting
from the fatigue of exertions which had seldom
been surpassed. But little breathing time was
allowed him. The attack instantly commenced,
and was maintained for three hours with unabated
fury.</p>

<p>When the retreat took place, Kennan was attached
to Major Clark's battalion, which had the
dangerous service of protecting the rear. The
corps quickly lost its commander, and was completely
disorganized. Kennan was among the hindmost
when the flight commenced, but exerting
those same powers which had saved him in the
morning, he quickly gained the front, passing several
horsemen in his flight.</p>

<p>Here he beheld a private in his own company,
lying upon the ground with his thigh broken, who,
in tones of distress, implored each horseman as he
hurried by to take him up behind. As soon as he
beheld Kennan coming up on foot, he stretched
out his hands and entreated him to save him.
Notwithstanding the imminent peril of the moment,
his friend could not reject such an appeal, but,
seizing him in his arms, placed him upon his back,
and ran in this manner several hundred yards.</p>

<p>At length the enemy was gaining upon them
so fast, that Kennan saw their death was certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
unless he relinquished his burden. He accordingly
told his friend that he had used every exertion possible
to save his life, but in vain; that he must
relax his hold about his neck, or they would both
perish. The unhappy man, heedless of every remonstrance,
still clung convulsively to Kennan's
back, until the foremost of the enemy, armed with
tomahawks alone, were within twenty yards of
them. Kennan then drew his knife from its sheath,
and cut the fingers of his companion, thus compelling
him to relinquish his hold. The wounded
man fell upon the ground in utter helplessness, and
Kennan beheld him tomahawked before he had
gone thirty yards. Kennan, relieved from his burden,
darted forward with the activity which once
more brought him to the van. Here again he was
compelled to neglect his own safety to attend to
that of others.</p>

<p>The late Governor Madison, of Kentucky, who
afterward commanded the corps which defended
themselves so honorably at the River Raisin, was
at that time a subaltern in St. Clair's army. Being
a man of feeble constitution, he was totally exhausted
by the exertions of the morning, and was
found by Kennan sitting calmly upon a log, awaiting
the approach of his enemies. Kennan hastily
accosted him, and inquired the cause of his delay.
Madison, pointing to a wound which had bled profusely,
replied he was unable to walk further, and
had no horse. Kennan instantly ran back to the
spot where he had seen an exhausted horse grazing,
caught him without difficulty, and having assisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Madison to mount, walked by his side till they
were out of danger. Fortunately, the pursuit ceased
soon after, as the plunder of the camp presented
irresistible attractions to the Indians. The friendship
thus formed between these two young men
continued through life. Kennan never entirely
recovered from the immense exertions he was constrained
to make during this unfortunate expedition.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">The Three Counties of Kentucky united into One District&mdash;Colonel
Boone as a Farmer&mdash;He outwits a Party of Indians
who seek to capture him&mdash;Emigration to Kentucky&mdash;Outrages
by Indians&mdash;Failure of General Clark's Expedition.</p></blockquote>

<p>Kentucky now enjoyed a season of repose.
The revolution was ended, the independence of the
colonies recognized, and the cession of the British
posts in the northwest was considered inevitable.
The Indians had not the same incentives to warfare
and massacre as heretofore, though murder
was so congenial to their nature, and their hatred
of the whites was so intense, that it was unsafe to
trust to any regard of treaties on their part.</p>

<p>The year 1783, although marked by few stirring
incidents, was an important one in the history of
Kentucky.</p>

<p>She still belonged to Virginia, but the subject of
separation was discussed among the people, and it
was apparent to all that the day was not far distant
when she would be erected into an independent
State; but she organized on a new basis, as
may be said. The three counties were united in
one district, having a court of common law and
chancery, for the whole Territory. The seat of
justice was first established at Harrodsburg, but
was soon after removed to Danville, which continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
the capital and most important town in the
State for a number of years.</p>

<p>Upon the cessation of hostilities between England
and the Colonies, it was stipulated that the
former were to carry away no slaves, were to surrender
to the United States her posts in the Northwest,
and were permitted to collect the legal debts
due her from our citizens.</p>

<p>Each party violated these conditions. Virginia
peremptorily forbade the collection of a single debt
within her territory until every slave taken away
was returned; while England, on her part, refused
to surrender a post until all the debts due her subjects
had been legally recognized and collected.
The result of these complications was that England
held her posts in the Northwest for ten years after
the close of the war.</p>

<p>Colonel Boone, as was his custom, devoted himself
to his farm, and was engaged in the cultivation
of considerable tobacco, though he never used the
weed himself. As a shelter for curing it, he had
built an enclosure of rails which was covered with
cane and grass. The raising of tobacco has become
so common of late in many States of the Union,
that nearly all understand the process. Boone had
placed the plants so that they lay in three tiers on
the rails, the lowermost one having become very
dry. One day, while in the act of removing the
lower pile, so as to make room for the rest of his
crop, four stalwart Indians entered, carrying guns.</p>

<p>When Boone looked down into the grinning
faces of the warriors, he understood what it meant:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
they had come to take him away prisoner, as he
had been taken before.</p>

<p>"We got you now, Boone," said one of them;
"you no get away; we carry you to Chillicothe."</p>

<p>Boone, of course, had no gun at command, as he
was not expecting any such visit, while each of the
Shawanoes carried a rifle and held it so as to command
him.</p>

<p>When Boone looked more narrowly into their
faces, he recognized one or two of the Shawanoes
who had captured him five years before near the
Blue Licks.</p>

<p>He affected to be pleased, and called back, with
a laugh,</p>

<p>"How are you, friends? I'm glad to see you."</p>

<p>But they were not disposed to wait, for they had
ventured, at considerable risk, to steal thus close to
the settlement, in their eagerness to secure such a
noted prisoner as Colonel Boone.</p>

<p>They, therefore, pointed their guns at him in a
menacing way, and suggested that the best plan for
him to induce them not to pull the triggers was to
descend immediately.</p>

<p>"I don't see as there is any help for it," was the
reply of the pioneer, "but, as I have started to
shift this tobacco, I hope you'll wait a few minutes
till I can shift it. Just watch the way I do it."</p>

<p>The four warriors were unsuspicious, and, standing
directly under the mass of dry pungent stuff,
they looked up at the pioneer as he began moving
the rails. He continued talking to his old acquaintances,
as though they were valued friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
who had just dropped in for a chat, and they
turned their black eyes curiously upon him, with
no thought of the little stratagem he was arranging
with such care and skill.</p>

<p>By and by Boone got a large pile of the tobacco
in position directly over their heads, and then suddenly
drew the rails apart, so as to allow it to fall.</p>

<p>At the same instant, with his arms full of the
suffocating weed, he sprang among them and dashed
it into their faces. Distributing it as impartially
as he could, in the few seconds he allowed himself,
he dashed out of the shed and ran for his house,
where he could seize his rifle, and defend himself
against twice the number.</p>

<p>Great as was his danger, he could not help stopping,
when he had run most of the distance, and
looking back to see how his visitors were making out.</p>

<p>The sight was a curious one. The eyes of the
four warriors were full of the smarting dust, and they
were groping about, unable to see, and resembling a
party engaged in blind-man's buff. These warriors
were able to speak English quite well, and they
used some very emphatic expressions in the efforts
to put their feelings into words. If they expected
to find Boone in these aimless gropings they were
mistaken, for he reached his cabin, where he was
safe from them, had they been in the full possession
of their faculties.</p>

<p>When the Shawanoes had managed to free their
eyes to some extent from the biting, pungent dust,
they moved off into the woods and made no more
calls upon the pioneer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Emigration to Kentucky increased, and new
settlements were continually forming. Strong,
sturdy settlers erected their cabins in every quarter,
and the forests were rapidly cleared. Livestock
increased in numbers, and naturally a brisk
trade sprang up in many commodities. Trains of
pack-horses carried goods from Philadelphia to
Pittsburgh, where they were taken down the Ohio
in flat-boats and distributed among the various
settlements.</p>

<p>As the expression goes, in these later days, everything
was "booming" in Kentucky during those
years, and the Territory made immense strides in
material wealth and prosperity. Most of the immigrants
came from North Carolina and Virginia,
and they were hospitable, enterprising, vigorous
and strongly attached to each other.</p>

<p>The time for "universal peace," along the frontier
had not yet come; small affrays were continually
occurring between the settlers and Indians,
and in the spring of 1784, an incident of a
singular nature took place. A Mr. Rowan, with
his own and five other families, was descending the
Ohio, one flat-boat being occupied by the cattle,
while the emigrants were in the other. They had
progressed a considerable distance, when, late at
night, they were alarmed by the number of Indian
fires which were burning for a half mile along the
banks. The savages called to the whites and
ordered them to come ashore, but, without making
any reply, the settlers continued floating silently
down the river. Finding their orders disregarded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
the savages sprang into their canoes and paddled
rapidly toward the boats; but, in this instance,
certainly silence proved golden, for the unnatural
stillness which continued seemed to awe the Indians,
who, after following the craft awhile, drew
off without inflicting the slightest injury. Most
likely they were fearful of a surprise, in case of an
open attack.</p>

<p>In the month of March, 1785, a settler named
Elliot was killed and his family broken up, and
while Thomas Marshall was descending the Ohio,
he was hailed in the fashion often adopted by the
decoys employed by the Indians. In this instance,
however, the white man said he was a brother of
the notorious Simon Girty, and he wished to warn
the settlers against their danger. He admonished
them to be on the watch every hour of the day and
night, and under no circumstances to approach the
shore.</p>

<p>He added the remarkable information that his
brother repented the hostility he had shown the
whites, and intended to return to them, if they
would overlook his former enmity. But, as Simon
remained a bitter enemy until his death, nearly
thirty years later, his repentance could not have
been very sincere.</p>

<p>A brief while after this, Captain Ward was attacked
on the river and all his horses were killed,
his nephew also falling a victim. In October an
emigrant party was fired into, and six slain, then
another company lost nine; and the desultory warfare
was pushed with such persistency by the savages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
that the settlers demanded that the Indian
country should be invaded and a blow delivered
which would prove effectual in keeping them away
for a long time to come.</p>

<p>The situation of affairs became so exasperating
that General Clark, in accordance with the fashion,
issued his call for volunteers, and in a brief space
of time a thousand veterans flocked about him at
the Falls of the Ohio.</p>

<p>This was an army which, if properly handled,
was irresistible and could have marched straight
through the Indian country, laying the fields and
towns waste and dispersing any force the tribes
could combine against them.</p>

<p>But, from the first, it encountered two most
serious difficulties: General Clark had lost prestige
from his habits of intoxication, which unfitted him
to assume the leadership of such an important enterprise,
where a man needed to be cool, collected,
and with the command of every faculty of his
being.</p>

<p>But for this one fatal weakness, which has
stricken so many a genius to the dust, Clark would
have risen to far greater eminence, and would have
reached and held the position through life to which
his commanding genius entitled him.</p>

<p>The provisions for the soldiers were sent down
the river in keel boats, but the obstructions delayed
them, and, when two weeks passed without
their arrival, the dissatisfaction of the men broke
out in open insubordination. Desertions began,
and in one instance, it is said, three hundred soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
left in a body. General Clark protested,
begged and entreated, but all in vain. His force
went to pieces, like snow melting in the sun, and
he was finally forced to return to Kentucky, humiliated
beyond measure.</p>

<p>Whenever any such movement was started by
the whites, the Indians kept themselves informed
of every step of its progress. Their spies were out
and allowed no incident, however slight, to escape
their observation. It was natural, therefore, that
when they saw the formidable force break up and
go to their homes, they should conclude that the
settlers were afraid to invade their territory, with
the lesson of the former repeated failures before
their eyes.</p>

<p>The Indians were stimulated to greater audacity
than ever, and it may be said that the whole border
became aflame with the most murderous kind
of warfare.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">General Harmar's Expedition against the Indians&mdash;Colonel
Hardin Ambushed&mdash;Bravery of the Regulars&mdash;Outgeneraled
by the Indians&mdash;Harmar and Hardin Court-martialed&mdash;General
St. Clair's Expedition and its Defeat.</p></blockquote>

<p>The outrages upon the part of the Indians became
so alarming that Congress was forced to see that
the only way to check them and to give anything
like security to the frontier, was to send a regularly-organized
army into the country, which should so
cripple the power of the combined tribes that they
would be compelled to sue for peace.</p>

<p>A force of eleven hundred men was therefore
organized and placed under the command of General
Harmar, who was directed to march against the
Indian towns of the Northwest. In the latter part
of September, Harmar, at the head of this large
body, moved against the villages on the Miami.
The savages, as a matter of course, knew of their
coming, and were gone. General Harmar laid
waste their cornfields and applied the torch to their
lodges, making the destruction as complete as possible.
Discovering a fresh trail, he detached one
hundred and eighty of his men, and placing them
under the command of Colonel John Hardin and
Ensign Hartshorn, sent them with orders to move
with all speed with a view of overtaking the fugitives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Pursuit was pushed with great vigor, when the
whole force ran directly into ambush and were
assailed on all sides by a large force of Indians.
At the beginning of the attack, the militia, numbering
five-sixths of the whole force, broke and
scattered, while the few regulars stood their ground
and fought bravely, until nearly every man was
shot down.</p>

<p>When night came, the Indians held a jollification
dance over the dead and dying soldiers, and the
great victory they themselves had again obtained.
Among the witnesses of the curious scene were
Ensign Hartshorn (who, having stumbled over a
log in the tall grass, was prudent enough to lie still
where he was unnoticed) and Colonel Hardin, who
was sunk to his chin in mud and water, where he
stayed until he gained an opportunity of crawling
out. He and Hartshorn succeeded in rejoining the
main body.</p>

<p>The news of the frightful slaughter so discouraged
General Harmar that he broke up his camp
and began a retrogade movement toward the settlements.
When a few miles from the Indian towns
which he had burned, he halted and sent out
Colonel Hardin with three hundred militia and
sixty regulars.</p>

<p>They were victimized more shamefully than before.
It seems unaccountable how men in such
circumstances, and with the crimson lessons of the
preceding few years before them, could be so deceived
as were the leaders of the expeditions in the
West.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Colonel Hardin had not advanced far, when a
small company of warriors showed themselves and
succeeded with little difficulty in drawing off the
militia in pursuit of them&mdash;the very purpose of the
stratagem&mdash;and then the main body of savages
attacked the regulars in overwhelming force and
with tiger-like ferocity.</p>

<p>Although unused to such fighting, the regulars
stood their ground like Spartans, and loaded and
fired with great accuracy and rapidity. The warriors
dropped like autumn leaves, and had there
been only a few hundred of them, the soldiers
would have routed them very quickly; but re-enforcements
continued to swarm forward, the woods
were alive, and every tree and bush seemed to conceal
a savage who aimed with deadly effect at the
brave soldiers.</p>

<p>The latter stood and fought until only ten men
were left, including their intrepid commander.
These escaped, while fifty were killed&mdash;the fight,
scarcely heard of in this day, being one of the most
remarkable exhibitions of bravery ever given in the
history of our country.</p>

<p>Just about the time the little force was practically
annihilated, the militia came back, so as to
take their turn in offering themselves as victims to
Indian treachery and bravery. The warriors were
ready for them, and they were attacked with the
same fierceness. The horrible massacre went on
until two-thirds of the militia were slain, when the
others scattered for the main body.</p>

<p>It would seem that mismanagement could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
go further, and the indignation against Harmar
and Hardin was so intense that they were court-martialed.
Hardin obtained a unanimous acquittal,
as did Harmar; but the latter felt the disgrace
so keenly that he resigned his commission in the
army.</p>

<p>One of the inevitable results of these repeated
blunders on the part of the soldiers was the renewal
of the Indian outrages, which became bolder than
ever. The condition of Kentucky was so critical
that Congress appointed St. Clair, Governor of the
Northwest Territory, Major-General, and he was
instructed to raise a new regiment for the defence
of the frontier.</p>

<p>General St. Clair was given command of the expedition,
and it was the crowning act of imbecility
and disgrace on the part of those who had in
charge the protection of the border. Arthur St.
Clair was born at Edinburgh, Scotland, and was in
the prime of life when he assumed command of the
expedition against the western tribes. It was he
who in the month of June, 1777, was besieged in
Ticonderoga by Burgoyne's troops and compelled
to evacuate the fort with great loss. His career in
the Revolution had not been creditable to him, and
there was no man in whom the Kentuckians had
less confidence than he. When it became known
that he was to lead the large force against the Indians,
the dissatisfaction was universal, and the predictions
of failure were heard in every quarter.</p>

<p>The distrust was so deep that his call for volunteers
received no response. It was intended that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
his command should consist of two thousand regular
troops, composed of cavalry, infantry and artillery.
These rendezvoused at Fort Washington, the
site of Cincinnati, in September, 1791. Kentucky
finally sent forward a thousand of her militia, but
they so disliked service under St. Clair, that the
most of them deserted and returned to their homes.</p>

<p>The chief object of this formidable campaign
was to establish a series of posts, extending from
the Ohio to the Maumee; and by leaving a garrison
of a thousand men on the latter river, it was
believed that the neighboring tribes could be kept
in a state of submission.</p>

<p>Fort Jefferson was established close to the present
boundary line between Ohio and Indiana, but
the progress of the army was so snail-like that desertions
became numerous. A month passed before
the march was resumed, and the impatient Kentuckians
left by scores. In one instance at least a
whole detachment drew off and went home.</p>

<p>The principal guide and scout attached to the
expedition was a Chickasaw chief, who saw what
was certain to be the result of this wholesale insubordination,
and he with his few warriors also left.
The wiser course would have been for St. Clair to
have done the same, for nothing but irretrievable
disaster stared him in the face.</p>

<p>St. Clair, however, pressed forward, and on the
3d of November, he encamped upon a tributary
of the Wabash. Indians were seen continually, but
they kept beyond reach. The regulars and levies
encamped in two lines, covered by the stream, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
the militia were a quarter of a mile in advance on
the other side of the river. Beyond these, Captain
Clough was stationed with a company of regulars,
with orders to intercept the advance of the enemy.
Colonel Oldham was directed to send out patrols
of twenty-five men each, through the woods to prevent
the insidious approach of the Indians.</p>

<p>No attack was made, but during the succeeding
night, Captain Clough was rendered uneasy by the
discovery that the woods were full of savages, who
were evidently carrying out some pre-arranged plan,
for the tribes had proven long before their ability
to outgeneral the whites in fighting battles in the
forest.</p>

<p>The captain reported his discovery to General
Butler, who failed to notify the commanding general,
and, at sunrise, the Indians made a furious
charge upon the camp of the militia. The regulars,
as usual, fought with the greatest daring, and
the militia, as usual, displayed the greatest cowardice,
breaking and fleeing in a panic. The regulars
were enabled to hold the savages in check for a
short time, but the panic of the militia was irretrievable.</p>

<p>There were none quicker to perceive this than
the Indians themselves, who immediately massed
and poured a terribly destructive fire into the advance,
the artillery and the second line.</p>

<p>The surprise was complete, but credit must be
given St. Clair and his officers, who were personally
brave, and who fought with the utmost daring,
striving at great personal risk to rally the men.</p>

Account of a Night with Colonel Boone&mdash;Hunting

<p>While the stirring events recorded in the preceding
chapter were taking place, Daniel Boone,
like every one else, was advancing in years, and the
prime of his life was passed before a lasting peace
was gained by the American settlers on the frontier.</p>

<p>Disaster followed disaster, until Congress at last
did the thing which it ought to have done long
before. "Mad Anthony" Wayne, the hero of
Stony Point and a dozen Revolutionary battlefields,
was appointed to assume the military management
of affairs in the West.</p>

<p>This appointment was made in April, 1792,
when he became Major-General and Commander-in-Chief,
and he led an expedition against the defiant
combination of tribes, encountering them in
August, 1794, when he utterly defeated and overthrew
them. He compelled the treaty of Greenville,
which ended all danger from any combination
of the aborigines&mdash;nothing of the kind developing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
itself, until the great Tecumseh roused his race
against the Americans in the war of 1812.</p>

<p>Boone now applied himself with great industry
to the cultivation of his farm near Boonesborough.
He soon made it one of the finest and most valuable
pieces of land in the country; but, like many
a man in his position, he fell a victim to the rapacious
speculator, who took advantage of the intricacies
and elasticity of the law.</p>

<p>Boone felt such a dislike of legal forms, and in
fact of everything that pertained to them, that he
failed to secure the title of his land locations.
Before he suspected his danger, he found himself
deprived of all his possessions, the right to which
he never dreamed would be questioned.</p>

<p>The great pioneer had reached that period in
life when it would be supposed that he was too
feeble to begin over again, but, although the misfortune
was a great blow to him, he did not lose
courage. He removed to Point Pleasant, on the
Kanawha River, in Virginia, where he stayed several
years, tilling the ground with his usual industry,
and indulging also in his favorite pastime
of hunting.</p>

<p>One day, when he returned from hunting, he received
a call from a number of friends who had
been on a tour across the Missouri. They gave such
fervid accounts of the richness of the soil and the
abundance of game, that the heart of the old
pioneer was fired again as it was forty years before.
He determined to emigrate to Missouri with
the purpose of spending the remainder of his days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
there. Accordingly, with his household goods and
family, he turned his back forever upon the land
of his early sufferings and triumphs. This removal
was probably made in 1797, though the precise
date is unknown.</p>

<p>At the time named, Spain owned the country,
then called Upper Louisiana, and the fame of the
renowned pioneer had extended to that comparatively
remote region. The Lieutenant-Governor,
residing at St. Louis, promised him ample portions
of land, and Boone took up his residence in the
Femme-Osage settlement, some 50 miles west of
St. Louis. Don Charles D. Delassus, the Lieutenant-Governor,
presented Boone with a commission,
in 1800, as Commandant of the Femme-Osage District&mdash;an
office which included both civil and
military duties.</p>

<p>Boone accepted the office, and discharged the
duties connected with it with great credit, up to
the time when the territory was purchased by the
United States in 1804. Boone lived with his son,
Daniel M., until the date named, when he changed
his residence to that of his son Nathan, with whom
he tarried six years, when he became a member of
the family of his son-in-law, Flanders Callaway.</p>

<p>It was at this period that the great naturalist
Audubon spent a night with Boone, the account
of which is so interesting, that we venture to give
it the reader:</p>

<p>"Daniel Boone, or as he was usually called in the
Western country, Colonel Boone, happened to
spend a night with me under the same roof, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
than twenty years ago. We had returned from a
shooting excursion, in the course of which his extraordinary
skill in the management of the rifle had
been fully displayed. On retiring to the room
appropriated to that remarkable individual and
myself, I felt anxious to know more of his exploits
and adventures than I did, and accordingly took
the liberty of proposing numerous questions to him.
The stature and general appearance of this Wanderer
of the Western forests approached the gigantic.
His chest was broad and prominent; his
muscular powers displayed themselves in every
limb; his countenance gave indication of his great
courage, enterprise, and perseverance; and when
he spoke, the very motion of his lips brought the
impression that whatever he uttered could not be
otherwise than strictly true. I undressed, whilst he
merely took off his hunting-shirt, and arranged a
few folds of blankets on the floor, choosing rather
to lie there, as he observed, than on the softest
bed. When we had both disposed of ourselves,
each after his own fashion, he related to me the
following account of his powers of memory, which
I lay before you, kind reader, in his own words,
hoping that the simplicity of the style may prove
interesting to you:</p>

<p>"'I was once,' said he, 'on a hunting expedition
on the banks of the Green River, when the lower
parts of this State (Kentucky) were still in the
hands of nature, and none but the sons of the soil
were looked upon as its lawful proprietors. We
Virginians had for some time been waging a war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
of intrusion upon them, and I, amongst the rest,
rambled through the woods in pursuit of their race,
as I now would follow the tracks of any ravenous
animal. The Indians outwitted me one dark night,
and I was unexpectedly as suddenly made a prisoner
by them. The trick had been managed with
great skill, for no sooner had I extinguished the
fire of my camp, and laid me down to rest in full
security, as I thought, than I felt myself seized by
an indistinguishable number of hands, and was immediately
pinioned, as if about to be led to the
scaffold for execution. To have attempted to be
refractory would have proved useless and dangerous
to my life; and I suffered myself to be removed
from my camp to theirs, a few miles distant,
without uttering even a word of complaint. You
are aware, I dare say, that to act in this manner
was the best policy, as you understand that by so
doing I proved to the Indians at once that I was
born and bred as fearless of death as any of themselves.</p>

<p>"'When we reached the camp, great rejoicings
were exhibited. Two squaws and a few pappooses
appeared particularly delighted at the sight of me,
and I was assured by very unequivocal gestures and
words, that, on the morrow, the mortal enemy of
the Redskins would cease to live. I never opened
my lips, but was busy contriving some scheme which
might enable me to give the rascals the slip before
dawn. The women immediately fell a searching
my hunting-shirt for whatever they might think
valuable, and, fortunately for me, soon found my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
flask filled with <i>Monongahela</i> (that is, reader, strong
whisky). A terrific grin was exhibited on their
murderous countenances, while my heart throbbed
with joy at the anticipation of their intoxication.
The crew immediately began to beat their bellies
and sing, as they passed the bottle from mouth to
mouth. How often did I wish the flask ten times
its size, and filled with aqua fortis! I observed
that the squaws drank more freely than the warriors,
and again my spirits were about to be depressed,
when the report of a gun was heard in the
distance. The singing and drinking were both
brought to a stand, and I saw, with inexpressible
joy, the men walk off to some distance and talk to
the squaws. I knew they were consulting about
me, and I foresaw that in a few moments the warriors
would go to discover the cause of the gun
having been fired so near their camp. I expected
the squaws would be left to guard me. Well, sir, it
was just so. They returned; the men took up
their guns and walked away. The squaws sat down
again, and in less than five minutes had my bottle
up to their dirty mouths, gurgling down their
throats the remains of the whisky.</p>

<p>"'With what pleasure did I see them becoming
more and more drunk, until the liquor took such
hold of them that it was quite impossible for these
women to be of any service. They tumbled down,
rolled about, and began to snore; when I, having
no other chance of freeing myself from the cords that
fastened me, rolled over and over towards the fire,
and, after a short time, burned them asunder. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
rose on my feet, stretched my stiffened sinews,
snatched up my rifle, and, for once in my life,
spared that of Indians. I now recollect how desirous
I once or twice felt to lay open the skulls of
the wretches with my tomahawk; but, when I
again thought upon killing beings unprepared and
unable to defend themselves, it looked like murder
without need, and I gave up the idea.</p>

<p>"'But, sir, I felt determined to mark the spot,
and, walking to a thrifty ash sapling, I cut out of it
three large chips, and ran off. I soon reached the
river, soon crossed it, and threw myself deep into
the canebrakes, imitating the tracks of an Indian
with my feet, so that no chance might be left for
those from whom I had escaped to overtake me.</p>

<p>"'It is now nearly twenty years since this happened,
and more than five since I left the whites'
settlements, which I might probably never have
visited again had I not been called on as a witness
in a lawsuit that was pending in Kentucky, and
which I really believe would never have been
settled, had I not come forward and established
the beginning of a certain boundary line. This is
the story, sir:</p>

<p>"'Mr. &mdash;&mdash; moved from old Virginia into Kentucky,
and having a large tract granted him in the
new State, laid claim to a certain parcel of land
adjoining Green River, and, as chance would have
it, took for one of his corners the very ash-tree on
which I had made my mark, and finished his survey
of some thousands of acres, beginning, as it is
expressed in the deed, 'at an ash marked by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
three distinct notches of the tomahawk of a white
man.'</p>

<p>"'The tree had grown much, and the bark had
covered the marks; but, somehow or other, Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; heard from some one all that I have already
said to you, and thinking that I might remember
the spot alluded to in the deed, but which was no
longer discoverable, wrote for me to come and try
at least to find the place of the tree. His letter
mentioned that all of my expenses should be paid,
and, not caring much about once more going back
to Kentucky, I started and met Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. After
some conversation, the affair with the Indians came
to my recollection. I considered for a while, and
began to think that after all, I could find the very
spot, as well as the tree, if it was yet standing.</p>

<p>"'Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and I mounted our horses, and off
we went to the Green River bottoms. After some
difficulties&mdash;for you must be aware, sir, that great
changes have taken place in those woods&mdash;I found
at last the spot where I had crossed the river, and,
waiting for the moon to rise, made for the course
in which I thought the ash-tree grew. On approaching
the place, I felt as if the Indians were
there still, and as if I were still a prisoner among
them. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and I camped near what I conceived
the spot, and waited until the return of
day.</p>

<p>"'At the rising of the sun, I was on foot, and
after a good deal of musing, thought that an ash-tree
then in sight must be the very one on which
I had made my mark. I felt as if there could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
no doubt of it, and mentioned my thought to
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. 'Well, Colonel Boone,' said he, 'if you
think so, I hope it may prove true, but we must
have some witnesses; do you stay hereabout, and
I will go and bring some of the settlers whom I
know.' I agreed. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; trotted off, and I, to
pass the time, rambled about to see whether a deer
was still living in the land. But ah! sir, what a
wonderful difference thirty years make in a country!
Why, at the time I was caught by the Indians, you
would not have walked out in any direction for
more than a mile without shooting a buck or a
bear. There were then thousands of buffaloes on
the hills of Kentucky; the land looked as if it never
would become poor; and to hunt in those days
was a pleasure indeed. But when I was left to
myself on the banks of Green River, I dare say for
the last time in my life, a few <i>signs</i> only of deer
were to be seen, and, as to a deer itself, I saw
none.</p>

<p>"'Mr. &mdash;&mdash; returned, accompanied by three
gentlemen. They looked upon me as if I had been
Washington himself, and walked to the ash-tree,
which I now called my own, as if in quest of a long-lost
treasure. I took an axe from one of them, and
cut a few chips off the bark. Still no signs were to
be seen. So I cut again until I thought it was
time to be cautious, and I scraped and worked
away with my butcher-knife until I <i>did</i> come to
where my tomahawk had left an impression in the
wood. We now went regularly to work, and
scraped at the tree with care until three hacks, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
plain as any three notches ever were, could be seen.
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and the other gentlemen were astonished,
and I must allow I was as much surprised as
pleased myself. I made affidavit of this remarkable
occurrence in presence of these gentlemen.
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; gained the cause. I left Green River forever,
and came to where we now are; and, sir, I
wish you a good night.'"</p>

<p>Spain seemed glad to do honor to the great pioneer,
Daniel Boone, who was so well known at
that time, that no less a poet than Lord Byron
rendered tribute to his daring and achievements.
Spain gave him a tract of land, numbering 8,500
acres, which was meant as a recognition of his
services to the government. The law as it then
existed, required, in order to make his title good,
that the grant should be confirmed by the representative
of the crown at New Orleans, and another
condition was that the grantee should reside
upon it himself.</p>

<p>As it would have been inconvenient on the part
of Boone to comply with the latter provision,
the commandant at St Louis, who was his warm
friend, assured him that his title could be perfected
without acceding to the requirement.</p>

<p>Boone's dear experience in Kentucky should
have been remembered, but he left everything to
his friends, and when Louisiana came into the
possession of the United States, it was found that
Boone had not the shadow of a legal title to the
lands presented him, and the commissioners had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
choice, according to their instructions, but to reject
his claim entirely.</p>

<p>This was a serious blow, but the only one who
could be censured was Boone himself. However,
there was no fear of his coming to want, for he not
only had a large number of immediate relatives, all
of whom were strongly attached to him, but the
States of Kentucky and Missouri would never permit
any such disgrace.</p>

<p>Boone liked Missouri, for the people were kind
and hospitable and game was plenty. He could
never lose his fondness for the woods, and as the
beaver were numerous and their furs valuable, he
made considerable money by gathering and selling
the peltries.</p>

<p>At the end of several years he had amassed
enough funds to carry out an intention which does
him great credit. When he removed from Kentucky
he was obliged to leave several debts behind
him, the memory of which disturbed him not a
little. He now made a journey to the State,
where he paid every creditor in full, and returned
to Missouri with just half a dollar in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Now I am ready to die," said he; "I have paid
all my debts, and when I am gone, no one shall be
able to say I was a dishonest man."</p>

<p>It would scarcely be expected that in his old
age, and in the new country to which he had emigrated,
he would be subjected to danger from the
Indians, and yet he was placed in peril more than
once.</p>

<p>His principal companion on his hunting excursions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
was a black boy about half grown. While
thus engaged they were attacked by a small party
of Osage Indians, who, however, were not long in
learning that the old fire still burned brightly, for
they were speedily scattered without having inflicted
any injury upon either of the hunters.</p>

<p>On another occasion, while Boone was hunting
entirely alone, he discovered that a large encampment
of Indians was in the neighborhood, and he
had reason to believe that a number of the warriors
were hunting for him.</p>

<p>Boone, it will be remembered, was quite an old
man, and it must have recalled the scenes of nearly
forty years before, when he alternately hunted and
hid in the Kentucky wilderness, before the foot of
any other white man had penetrated the solitudes.</p>

<p>For nearly three weeks the pioneer lived that
life over again, hiding in the deepest recesses of the
forest, carefully concealing his trail and cooking
his food only at the dead of night, so that the
smoke should not be seen by the Indians, who
finally took their departure, without being able to
catch a glimpse of the old hunter.</p>

<p>His love for the woods knew no abatement with
advancing years, and he spent hours, days, and
even weeks, in wandering in the grand old forests,
breathing the pure fresh air, shooting the timid
deer, maneuvering against the Indians, who tracked
him many a mile, and returning to his home
wearied, but with the same genial good nature,
which was one of his distinguishing traits in his
early days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
In the year 1812, Colonel Boone petitioned Congress
for a confirmation of his original claims,
and knowing that such petitions cannot have too
great weight, he sent a memorial to the General
Assembly of Kentucky, asking their assistance in
obtaining the desired confirmation from Congress.</p>

<p>That legislature by a unanimous vote, passed
the following preamble and resolutions:</p>

<p>"The Legislature of Kentucky, taking into view
the many eminent services rendered by Colonel
Boone, in exploring and settling the Western
country, from which great advantages have resulted,
not only to this State, but to his country in
general; and that, from circumstances over which
he had no control, he is now reduced to poverty,
not having, so far as appears, an acre of land out of
the vast territory he has been a great instrument in
peopling; believing, also, that it is as unjust as impolitic,
that useful enterprise and eminent services
should go unrewarded by a government where
merit confers the only distinction; and having
sufficient reason to believe that a grant of ten
thousand acres of land which he claims in Upper
Louisiana, would have been confirmed by the
Spanish government, had not said territory passed,
by cession, into the hands of the general government;
wherefore,</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, By the General Assembly of the
Commonwealth of Kentucky, that our senators in
Congress be requested to make use of their exertions
to procure a grant of land in said Territory
to said Boone, either the ten thousand acres to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
which he appears to have an equitable claim, from
the grounds set forth to this Legislature, by way of
confirmation, or to such quantity in such place as
shall be deemed most advisable, by way of donation."</p>

<p>While his memorial was pending in Congress,
the wife of Boone died at the age of seventy-six
years. His memorial was strongly supported by
the most distinguished members from the West,
but no action could be secured upon it until the
24th of December, 1813, when the committee on
public lands made a report, in which the justice of
Boone's claims was admitted, and Congress was
recommended to give him one thousand arpents, or
850 acres of land.</p>

<p>The act for the confirmation of the title passed
on the 10th of February, 1814. As every emigrant
to Louisiana was entitled by law to precisely
that number of acres, it is difficult to justify
the treatment which Boone received at the hands
of the law-makers of the country.</p>

<p>The pioneer was never given any other recognition
of his services; and as he was growing old, his
relatives, all of whom were tenderly attached to
him, saw that no want of his was not fulfilled so
far as it was possible for human kindness to fulfill
it. He devoted himself mainly to hunting, and,
when at home, carved powder-horns and made
trinkets for his descendants, some of whom were
to the fourth and fifth generation.</p>

<p>These last he frequently gathered around his
knees and told of his many thrilling adventures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
with the Indians, long years before they were
born, while he entertained the older friends on the
long, dismal wintry evenings, with his narrative of
his experiences on the Dark and Bloody Ground,
in the days that tried men's souls.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Last Days of Colonel Boone&mdash;Reinterment of the Remains of
Himself and Wife at Frankfort&mdash;Conclusion.</p></blockquote>

<p>The hunting days of Colonel Boone at last came
to an end. He had passed his three score and ten,
and the iron limbs and hardy frame were compelled
to bend before the infirmities of age,
to which Hercules himself must succumb in the
end.</p>

<p>So long as he was able, he kept up his hunting
expeditions in the wood, but on one occasion, he
was taken violently ill, and made his preparations
for death, his only companion being the negro
boy, who had been with him many times before.</p>

<p>He was brought to recognize at last the danger
of going beyond the immediate reach of his friends,
and for ten years he did not do so.</p>

<p>He was held in great affection and respect by
his numerous friends and relatives, and he was a
more than welcome visitor at the hearthstone of
each. The harsh treatment received at the hands
of the government could not embitter such a sweet
nature as his, and he showed no resentment over
the fact that the land upon which he had toiled in
the vigor of his early manhood, and whose labors
had made it exceptionally valuable, passed to the
hands of a stranger without cost or claim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
As the stream of life neared the great ocean beyond,
it assumed a serene and majestic flow, which
comes only from the assurance that no storms are
awaiting the bark which has been tossed so long on
the waves of suffering, danger and disaster.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1820, the well known American
artist, Chester Harding, visited Boone and
painted an excellent portrait of him. The old
pioneer was so feeble that he had to be supported
by a friend while sitting for the likeness.</p>

<p>Boone at this time made his home with his son-in-law,
Flanders Callaway, and he was continually
visited by distinguished citizens and foreigners,
who, having heard of the exploits of the explorer
of the wilderness, hastened to look upon him ere
the opportunity should pass forever.</p>

<p>Some years before his death he had his coffin
made, and kept it in the house. His temperate
habits, the active out-door life of his earlier days,
and his regard for the laws of health, naturally resulted
in a ripe old age, marked by the gradual
decay of the vital powers, and unaccompanied
by any pain, as should be the case with all mankind.</p>

<p>It was not until the month of September, 1820,
that the premonition of his coming end unmistakably
showed itself. He was attacked by a species
of fever, which did not prove severe, for he soon
recovered, and afterward visited his son Major
Nathan Boone. He was attacked again, was confined
to his bed three days, and peacefully passed
away on the 26th of September, in the eighty-sixth
year of his age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
The legislature of Missouri was in session at the
time, and as soon as the news reached it, adjourned,
after passing a resolution that its members
should wear the usual badge of mourning for
twenty days.</p>

<p>He was laid by the side of his wife, who died a
number of years before, an immense concourse attending
the funeral. There the remains of the
two lay for a quarter of a century, when an interesting
ceremony took place.</p>

<p>The consent of the family having been obtained,
the coffins were disinterred and removed to Frankfort,
Kentucky, and there placed in the new cemetery.</p>

<p>The ceremonies were touching and impressive.
Nearly three quarters of a century had passed since
the daring hunter and pioneer, in the flush of early
manhood, had threaded his way through the trackless
forests from the Old Pine State, and, crossing
mountain and stream, braving all manner of dangers,
had penetrated the solitudes of Kentucky and
laid the foundation of one of the grandest States
of the Union.</p>

<p>There were a few old men who had known
Boone, and they were present from different parts
of the State, with hundreds of friends, descendants
and relatives. The hearse was hung with lilies and
evergreens, and the ceremony was one which can
never be forgotten by those who took part in or
witnessed it.</p>

<p>A stirring and powerful address was delivered by
Senator J.&nbsp;J. Crittenden, in which eloquent tribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
was done the daring hunter, the intrepid scout, and
matchless pioneer.</p>

<p>In closing the biography of Colonel Daniel
Boone, we feel that the reader of these pages,
shares with us in our admiration of the stern integrity,
the unquestioned bravery, the clear self-possession,
and the honest simplicity of the most
illustrious type of the American pioneer, who, long
before his death, had fixed his place high and enduring
in the history of our country.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the latter part of the century,
Colonel Boone dictated his autobiography to
a friend, and nothing can be more appropriate as
an illustration of his character than these few
closing words, with which we lay down our pen:</p>

<p>"My footsteps have often been marked with
blood; two darling sons and a brother have I lost

forty valuable horses and cattle. Many dark and
sleepless nights have I been a companion for
owls, separated from the cheerful society of men,
scorched by the summer's sun, and pinched by the

wilderness.</p>

<p>"What thanks, what ardent and ceaseless thanks
are due to that all-superintending Providence which
has turned a cruel war into peace, brought order out
of confusion, made the fierce savages placid, and
turned away their hostile weapons from our country.</p>

<p>"May the same almighty goodness banish the
accursed monster, war, from all lands, with her
hated associates, rapine and insatiable ambition!</p>

<p>The fame of Simon Kenton, hunter and pioneer,
is scarcely second to that of Daniel Boone; he was
fully as courageous and equally skilled in woodcraft,
while personally more winning in manner. Had the
opportunities of Boone been his, he would have
achieved a fame scarcely less; but such as he was,
no history of the West would be complete without
mention of Boone's intimate friend, Simon Kenton.</p>

<p>Of the early years of Kenton little is known, and
it is not likely that they were marked by anything
worthy of mention. He was born in Fauquier
County, Virginia, May 15th, 1755. His parents
were very poor, and Simon led a life of drudging
toil on a farm, until he was sixteen, at which age
he was unable to read or write his name.</p>

<p>The young man, however, was strong, robust,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
very athletic, good looking, and with a pleasing,
musical voice. He was just the kind of youth to
become popular among the rough spirits of the
border, and it was at that time that an incident
occurred which marked an era in his life.</p>

<p>Young as Kenton was, he was a rival of another
in the esteem of an attractive young lady of the
neighborhood; and, as the lady herself seemed unwilling
to decide as to who was her preference,
Kenton and his rival agreed to decide it by a bout
at fisticuffs.</p>

<p>The conflict took place, but, through the treachery
of his rival, Kenton was terribly beaten. He
had no choice but to submit to the outrage in
silence, but, like Dr. Winship, the modern Samson,
he determined to get strong, and then punish the
one who had treated him so foully.</p>

<p>Within the year or two succeeding, Kenton
reached the stature of six feet, and, confident of
his own strength and skill, he called upon his former
rival and asked him to try conclusions again
with him. The other was also a powerful man and
gladly accepted the challenge, for he hated Kenton
intensely, and resolved to give him such a terrific
punishment that he would never be able to annoy
him again.</p>

<p>At first, the rival got the best of Kenton and injured
him severely; but the future scout was full of
grit, and he managed to secure the upper hand,
when he administered such a chastisement that
when he released his man he seemed to be gasping
in death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Kenton looked at him for a moment, and was so
certain he could not live a half hour longer, that
he was seized with a panic and fled. He did not
dare even to return home for a change of clothing,
but faced toward the West and ran as though his
pursuers were in sight.</p>

<p>Feeling no doubt that his rival was dead, he was
sure his avengers would be at his heels, and he
scarcely rested during the day. When, however,
he reached the neighborhood of the Warm Springs,
the settlements were so sparse that he drew a sigh
of relief, and felt that he was in no immediate peril
from the officers of the law.</p>

<p>Still Kenton did not dare pause for any length of
time, and he was walking forward when he came
upon a Jerseyman named Johnson, who was journeying
in the same direction.</p>

<p>It is at such times that the heart craves companionship,
and the two men affiliated at once. Johnson
was driving a pack-horse before him, and
seemed pretty well tired out; but he was full of
pluck, and it took but a few minutes for the two
adventurers fully to understand each other.</p>

<p>As a proof of the fear which Kenton felt that his
pursuers might overtake him, it may be stated at
this point that he changed his name to Simon Butler,
with a view of rendering it more difficult to
identify him.</p>

<p>The new friends penetrated the wilderness of the
Alleghanies, relying under heaven upon their own
prowess and bravery. Both were skillful marksmen,
and they had no difficulty in securing all the game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
they needed, while they kept unceasing watchfulness
against the prowling Indians, who, at
that day, were liable to spring upon them at any
time.</p>

<p>They pushed steadily forward until they reached
a small settlement at the forks of the Monongahela;
there they separated, and, so far as known, never
saw each other again.</p>

<p>At the settlement was a small company under
the leadership of John Mahon and Jacob Greathouse,
who had just made ready to explore the
country below them. Embarking in a large canoe,
they floated down the river until they reached the
Province's settlement. Here Kenton formed the
acquaintance of two young men, named Yager and
Strader, the former of whom had once been a captive
among the Indians.</p>

<p>He fired the heart of Kenton by his glowing accounts
of the region of Kentucky, which he declared
was a hunter's paradise.</p>

<p>"There is no richer soil in the world," said
Yager; "vegetation is so luxuriant that it will strike
you with wonder, and the herds of buffalo and elk
which roam through those woods are so immense
that you wouldn't believe me if I were to tell you
the numbers."</p>

<p>Kenton was sure there was some foundation for
the positive assertions of Yager, and he listened
eagerly to what he had to add;</p>

<p>"The region has no white men in it; any one
who chooses to hunt there can do so. I have gone
with the Indians many a time on their hunting excursions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
and I could lead you through the same.
If you will go with us, I will do so."</p>

<p>Kenton accepted the proposition with great
enthusiasm, declaring that he would start at
once.</p>

<p>Yager and Strader were equally hopeful, and in
a short time the three were drifting down the Ohio
in a single canoe.</p>

<p>Yager had lived among the Indians in his childhood,
and while he entertained a vivid recollection
of the incidents, he could not be positive concerning
the distances between certain points. He
was unable to say how far down the river they
would have to go to find the place where the Indians
crossed from Ohio into Kentucky to hunt,
but he was sure he would recognize the spot the
instant he saw it, for it was very different from any
other point on the stream, and was indelibly fixed
in his memory.</p>

<p>They were so anxious to reach the promised
land, as it seemed to be to them, that the men
rowed strongly and continuously, keeping at the
oars far into the night.</p>

<p>There can be no question as to Yager's honesty,
but he was led astray by his own impressions; the
crossing he was seeking was a great deal further
away than he believed.</p>

<p>Kenton and Strader began to think they were a
long time in arriving at a point so near at hand.
When they expressed their dissatisfaction, Yager
still insisted, and the lusty arms were plied again
with renewed vigor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
But, though the keen eyes scrutinized the shore
on either hand with a watchfulness which could not
be mistaken, they failed to discover anything resembling
the crossing, which Yager had described
so often and so vividly that the others saw it distinctly
in their mind's eye.</p>

<p>Kenton and Strader were not angered, but they
rallied their companion on his error, and suggested
that he was describing and they were searching
for a place which never had an existence, unless
it was in the imagination of the former Indian
captive.</p>

<p>Finally, Yager admitted that he didn't understand
how it was, unless they had passed the crossing
in the night.</p>

<p>"There <i>is</i> such a place," he asserted with great
positiveness, "for I saw it more than once,
when I was a child with the Indians, and I remember
it so well, that I would recognize it on
the instant. It must be that we went by it in the
night."</p>

<p>After awhile, they agreed to return and explore
the country more thoroughly. They did so, visiting
the land in the neighborhood of Salt Lick,
Little and Big Sandy, and Guyandotte. They finally
wearied of hunting for that which it seemed impossible
to find, and, locating on the Great Kanawha,
devoted themselves to hunting and trapping. They
found the occupation so congenial, that they pursued
it for two years, exchanging their furs and
peltries with the traders at Fort Pitt, for such necessaries
as hunters require.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
The period passed by these three men on the
Kanawha will be recognized by the reader as a
momentous one; for not only were the fires of the
Revolution kindling, but the embers of war along
the border were fanning into a blaze that was to
sweep over thousands of square miles of settlement
and wilderness, and to bring appalling disaster to
the West.</p>

<p>Nothing gives a more vivid idea of the insecurity
of the pioneers of Kentucky and Ohio, than the
bloodhound-like persistency with which the red
men hunted down all invaders of their soil. Boone
and his party, which might have been considered
strong enough to take care of themselves against
any ordinary war party, were attacked before they
caught more than a glimpse of the fair land; while
the settler, who builded his cabin close to the
frowning block-house, was shot down on his own
threshold.</p>

<p>Kenton and his two companions had spent
months enjoying their free, open life in the woods,
when the red men came down upon them like the
whirlwind.</p>

<p>It was in the month of March, 1773, while they
were stretched out in their rude tent, chatting and
smoking, that the dark woods around them suddenly
flamed with fire, and a volley was poured in
upon them, followed by the fierce shouts of the warriors,
who seemed to swarm up from the very earth.</p>

<p>Poor Strader was riddled with bullets, and
scarcely stirred, so instant was his death. By wonderful
good fortune, neither of the others was injured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
and, leaping to their feet, they bounded into
the woods like frightened deer, the bullets whistling
all about them and their ferocious enemies at their
heels.</p>

<p>The gathering darkness and their own fleetness
enabled them speedily to place themselves beyond
reach of the savages; but their plight was
a pitiable one.</p>

<p>So desperate was their haste, that neither had
time to catch up blanket, gun or a scrap of provisions;
an instant's pause would have been fatal.
And now they found themselves in the gloomy
woods, with the chilling wind cutting them to the
bone, and without the means even of starting a fire.</p>

<p>The brave fellows, however, did not despair.
They felt that while there was life there was hope,
and they determined to make for the Ohio without
delay. Had they possessed their guns, it would
have been an easy matter to secure such game as
they needed, and to kindle a fire, but with undaunted
hearts and with their knowledge of woodcraft
which enabled them to determine the direction
to the Ohio, they started for the river.</p>

<p>During the first two days, they allayed the pangs
of gnawing hunger by chewing succulent roots,
while the bark on the trees was a sufficient guide
to keep them going in the right direction. The
miserable nourishment, however, soon told, and
the third day found them much weaker, though
with their courage undiminished.</p>

<p>They grew feeble very fast, and both were seized
with a violent nausea, caused by the unwelcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
substances they had taken into their stomachs to
satisfy the pangs of hunger. Their condition became
so much worse on the fourth day, that, strong
men as they were, they felt it was useless to strive
longer. They threw themselves on the ground
with the intention of waiting for death, but when
they assumed the prone position, they seemed to
rally both in body and spirits, and, after awhile,
they would rise and press forward again.</p>

<p>On the fifth day, death appeared near to them,
and they were scarcely able to crawl. They staggered
and crept along for about a mile, and, just as
the sun was setting, found themselves on the bank
of the Ohio, which was a Beautiful River indeed to
them.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment, they came upon a
party of traders, and saw they were saved, for the
men gave them the provisions they needed, and
were anxious to do all in their power for the emaciated
and distressed hunters.</p>

<p>But the story told by the latter filled them with
such alarm for their own safety, that they prepared
to leave such a perilous section without delay.
Hastily gathering their effects together, they made
all haste to the Little Kanawha, where they encountered
another exploring party under the leadership
of Dr. Briscoe, who furnished Kenton with a
new rifle and ammunition. Yager had had enough
of the wilderness, and he stayed with his new-found
friends. But Kenton, with his gun and powder,
felt like a giant refreshed, and, bidding the others
good-bye, plunged alone into the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
He spent the following summer in hunting, just
as Daniel Boone did under somewhat similar circumstances,
and, toward the close of the season,
made his way back to the little Kanawha. Here
he found an exploring party under the direction of
Dr. Wood and Hancock Lee, who were descending
the Ohio with the purpose of joining Captain Bullitt,
whom they expected to find at the mouth of
the Scioto, with a company of pioneers so large
that nothing was to be feared from the Indians.</p>

<p>Kenton willingly accepted the invitation to join
them, and the descent of the stream was resumed.
They moved at a leisurely pace, often stopping on
the way to examine the country. They were not
disturbed by the Indians until they reached the
Three Islands. There, to their dismay, they discovered
such a formidable body of warriors, that
they were compelled to abandon their canoes precipitately,
and they hurried across the country in a
diagonal direction for Green Brier county, Virginia.</p>

<p>The journey was a most uncomfortable one, for
they were in constant danger from the red men,
and were afraid to pause long enough to secure and
prepare the necessary food.</p>

<p>To add to their troubles, the leader of the party,
Dr. Wood, while tramping along was bitten by a
venomous snake, known as the copperhead. The physician
applied all the remedies at his command,
but, for several days, he lay at the point of death
and unable to move. Despite the great danger of
pausing on the way, the party were compelled to
go into camp for a couple of weeks on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
their leader's condition. At the end of that time,
however, he had so far recovered that the journey
was resumed, and they reached the settlements
without further mishap.</p>

<p>Kenton was so sorely troubled by the recollection
of the affray with his rival several years before,
whom he supposed to be dead, that he was afraid
to remain in Virginia. Accordingly, he built a
canoe on the banks of the Monongahela, paddled
to the mouth of the Great Kanawha, and resumed
his hunting, which he prosecuted with great success
until the spring of 1774.</p>

<p>Then it was that a brief but virulent war broke
out between the Indians and Colonies, caused, as
will be remembered, by the murder of the family
of the celebrated Mingo chief, Logan. The part
played by Kenton in this campaign was the important
one of scout, in the execution of which duties
he tramped over the country around Fort Pitt and
a great deal of the present State of Ohio.</p>

<p>There still lingered in the mind of the daring
Kenton a strong faith in the statements made to
him by Yager that there were sections of the surrounding
country with a wonderfully rich soil,
abundant vegetation, and immense numbers of
game. He determined to make search for it, and
met with little difficulty in persuading two friends
to join in the hunt.</p>

<p>A strong canoe was constructed and stocked with
provisions, and the trio paddled down the river to
the mouth of Big Bone Creek, on which the famous
Big Bone Lick stands. There they landed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
spent several days in exploring the surrounding
country; but they were disappointed; nothing
answering the representations of Yager was discovered.</p>

<p>Entering their canoe once more, they ascended
the river to the entrance of Cabin Creek, a short
distance above Maysville. With faith undiminished,
they resolved upon a more thorough exploration.
In the prosecution of this purpose they came upon
May's Lick, where they saw that the surrounding
soil possessed unusual richness. Striking the well-known
great buffalo track, they followed it for a few
hours, when they reached the Lower Blue Lick.</p>

<p>The flats upon each side of the river were swarming
with thousands of buffalo that were attracted
thither by the salt, while a number of magnificent
elk were seen upon the crests of the ridges which
surrounded the brackish springs.</p>

<p>"This is the place!" exclaimed the delighted
Kenton; "this is the promised land that Yager
saw! We need go no further!"</p>

<p>His companions agreed with him, and the delighted
pioneers engaged in hunting at once. They
could not fail to bring down a great many buffaloes
and elk, when the splendid game had scarcely seen
enough of their great enemy, man, to learn to fear
him.</p>

<p>When they became surfeited with the sport, the
three crossed the Licking, and, after a long tramp,
came upon another buffalo trace, which led them
to the Upper Blue Lick, where they saw the same
bewildering abundance of game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Fully satisfied now that they had discovered the
richest and most promising section of all the West,
they returned to their canoes, and went up the
river as far as Green Bottom, where they had left
their peltries, some ammunition, and a few agricultural
implements, with the view of cultivating the
inviting soil.</p>

<p>They lost no time in hurrying back and beginning
the clearing of the land. An acre was denuded of
trees in the middle of a large canebrake, planted
with Indian corn, and a cabin erected. This was
on the spot where Washington now stands.</p>

<p>The pioneers were in high spirits; for after a
long search they had found the land they sighed
for, and the future looked promising and bright.
They settled down to hard work, and were confident
that the fertility of the soil would yield them
large returns.</p>

<p>While strolling about the woods one day, with
no particular object in view, they were surprised to
meet two men, named Hendricks and Fitzpatrick,
who were in a sad plight. In descending the Ohio,
their canoe had been upset by a sudden squall, and
they were forced to swim ashore, without being
able to save anything from the wreck. They had
been wandering though the woods for several days,
and would have perished soon had they not come
upon the little party of pioneers.</p>

<p>Kenton had been in a similar predicament, and
could not fail to sympathize with them. He urged
them to join the diminutive settlement he had
started at Washington, and trust to Providence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
bring them out right in the end. Hendricks agreed
to stay, but Fitzpatrick had had enough of the
wilderness, and was so homesick that he only asked
to get out of the unfriendly country and back to
the Monongahela. Kenton and his companions
went with him as far as Maysville, gave him a gun
and some ammunition, assisted him across the river,
and bade him good-by.</p>

<p>Pity it was that Hendricks did not accompany
him, as the sequel will prove.</p>

<p>While Kenton and his two brother pioneers were
doing this neighborly kindness for the one, Hendricks
was at the cabin which had been erected a
few days before. He had been left there without a
gun, but with plenty of provisions, and no one
dreamed of his being in danger.</p>

<p>The three men, having seen Fitzpatrick off,
hastened back to the clearing, pleased at the
thought of the companion they had gained, and
regretting that the other man had not consented
to join them.</p>

<p>When they reached the rough cabin they were
somewhat alarmed to see nothing of Hendricks,
and the quick eyes of the hunters observed that
something unusual had taken place. A number of
bullet-holes were noticed in the timbers, which were
chipped in other places by the leaden missiles,
while some of the articles of Hendricks were scattered
around in a way which could leave no doubt
he had been visited by Indians.</p>

<p>The fact that he had no weapon with which to
defend himself, caused his friends to fear the worst,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
and with rapidly beating hearts they began an investigation,
not knowing how close the peril was
to them.</p>

<p>They had not hunted far, when they discovered
a thin column of smoke rising from a ravine near
at hand. Certain that a large war party of savages
was near them, the three men were seized with a
panic and fled in the greatest terror.</p>

<p>It was a curious thing for Kenton to do, for he
was certainly one of the bravest of men. It would
have been expected that he would insist on an investigation
before such a precipitate flight, and it
was always a source of deep regret to him in
after-life that he did not do so.</p>

<p>Having reached a safe point, the trio hid themselves
in the cane until the evening of the next
day, when they once more ventured back to the
clearing, and then approached the ravine from
which they had seen the smoke of a camp-fire
ascending.</p>

<p>Smoke was still visible, and when they ventured
closer they were horrified to find only the
charred bones of their late companion! He had
been burned at the stake, and in all probability
was alive when the others first saw the vapor on
the previous day.</p>

<p>Had they not been so terrified by the belief that
a large war party was at hand, they might have
saved him. As we have said, it was the source of
the deepest regret to Kenton that he did not
reconnoitre the spot, when such a possibility of
rescue existed.</p>

<p>Simon Kenton and his two friends stayed at
Washington until the following September, undisturbed
by Indians, though they were never entirely
free from apprehension of a visit from them.</p>

<p>In the month named they visited the Lick, where
they encountered a white man, who told them most
important news. The interior of Kentucky had
been settled in several places, and there was a
thriving pioneer station at Boonesborough.</p>

<p>Kenton and his friends were glad to learn this,
for they had seen enough of the perils of the woods
to long for the society of some of their own race.
They immediately left their dangerous home, and,
visiting the smaller settlements, made a prolonged
stay at Boonesborough, where they were most
gladly welcomed. During the two sieges of the
place which we have described, Kenton was one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
the garrison, and served with great efficiency as a
spy and scout until the summer of 1778, when
Boone came back from captivity and formed the
plan for the attack upon the Indians at Paint
Creek.</p>

<p>This expedition, which has already been referred
to elsewhere, proved to be a most eventful one to
Kenton, who acted as spy. After crossing the Ohio,
he kept a considerable distance in advance, on the
alert for the first evidence of Indians.</p>

<p>He was suddenly startled by hearing a loud
laugh from an adjoining thicket, which he was on
the point of entering. Like a flash the scout
sprang behind a tree and with cocked rifle awaited
the explanation.</p>

<p>He had but a few minutes to wait, when two Indians
emerged from the thicket, mounted on a
pony. Both were laughing and chatting in high
spirits, and with no thought of anything like danger.
They had been on some marauding expedition
against the whites, and had met with such success
that they seemed as elated as a couple of
children.</p>

<p>Kenton held his place until they approached
within easy distance, when he took careful aim and
fired. The well-aimed shot killed the first and
badly wounded the second, while the frightened
pony whirled about and dashed into the thicket.
Kenton instantly ran up to the slain Indian to scalp
him, in accordance with the barbarous practice of
the border, when a rustling on his right caused him
to look up. To his amazement, there were two Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
not twenty yards distant, both of whom were
in the act of taking aim at him.</p>

<p>The scout sprang aside at the instant both fired,
and though the bullets whizzed close to his eyes he
was uninjured. There could be no doubt that the
neighborhood was a most undesirable one just then,
for other warriors were near by, and Kenton lost no
time in taking to the shelter of the woods.</p>

<p>Fleet as he was, he had no more than reached
shelter, when a dozen Indians appeared on the
margin of the canebrake and the situation of the
scout became most serious; but, at this critical
moment, Boone appeared with his party, who
opened a brisk fire upon the Indians. The attack
was so spirited that they broke and scattered,
and Kenton was relieved from his perilous position.</p>

<p>Boone, as we have stated elsewhere, immediately
returned to Boonesborough, but the intrepid Kenton
determined to learn more of the Indians, and
if possible to repay them for the attack they had
made upon him.</p>

<p>Accompanied by a friend named Montgomery,
they approached the Indian town not far off, and
stationed themselves near a cornfield, expecting
the red men would enter it for the purpose of
roasting the ears. With that characteristic patience
of the border scouts, they stayed beside the
cornfield the entire day waiting and watching for a
shot at some of the warriors. But during the time
not a single one appeared, though the whites
could hear the voices of the children playing near
at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
The scouts were greatly disappointed, for they
had been confident of seeing some warrior, but
night came without such an opportunity having
presented itself, and they were forced to ask themselves
the question whether they would go back
empty handed, so to speak, or whether they would
incur some additional risk for the sake of accomplishing
something by way of retaliation.</p>

<p>As the best they could do, they stealthily entered
the Indian town late at night, picked out
four good horses, made all haste to the Ohio,
which they crossed in safety, and on the succeeding
day reached Logan's fort without disturbance.</p>

<p>This was an extraordinary achievement, for the
Indians and settlers were in such open hostility
that it may be said the former were constantly on
the alert to prevent just such surprises.</p>

<p>Colonel Bowman, at the fort, requested Kenton,
Montgomery and a Mr. Clark to undertake a more
difficult and dangerous task for him: that was a
secret expedition to one of the Indian towns on
the Little Miami, against which the Colonel meditated
an expedition, and about which, of course, he
was desirous of gaining all the information possible.</p>

<p>The duty was a congenial one to the three men,
who reached the village without discovery, made a
careful reconnoissance by night, and were then
ready to return home.</p>

<p>Well would it have been for them had they done
so, but the subsequent conduct of Kenton shows
that his repeated escapes and continued immunity
at the hands of the savages, had rendered him reckless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
and caused him to estimate too highly perhaps
his own prowess and skill as compared with theirs.</p>

<p>At this time, unfortunately, they discovered an
enclosure where the Indians kept their horses.
Like all borderers they dearly loved that kind of
property, and could not resist the temptation.
More than that, instead of selecting the best, they
took the whole lot and started for the Ohio.</p>

<p>Such a wholesale proceeding created a good deal
of confusion despite the care of the three scouts,
and the Indians speedily discovered what was
going on.</p>

<p>They poured out of their wigwams and lodges,
in great excitement, all eager to prevent the loss
of their property, while the whites showed an
equal eagerness to get away with it. Instead of
abandoning the animals and attempting to save
themselves, they foolishly continued their effort to
escape with them all.</p>

<p>One rode in front leading the animals, and the
other two remained at the rear and lashed them
into a gallop, through the woods, while the excited
Indians came whooping and shrieking after them.</p>

<p>It was a wild, break-neck proceeding, but the
scouts kept it up until they reached the edge of an
impenetrable swamp, where, for the first time since
starting, they came to a stand-still and listened for
their pursuers.</p>

<p>Not a sound was heard, to indicate they were
anywhere in the neighborhood, and the whites congratulated
themselves on what looked like a remarkable
achievement. But they were certain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
be pursued, and skirting the swamp, they continued
their flight in the direction of the Ohio,
which was a long way distant.</p>

<p>The horses were pressed to the utmost, the
riders frequently changing animals, through the
night, the next day, and most of the following
night. The next morning they stood on the
northern bank of the Ohio.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing strongly, and the river
was so boisterous that the crossing was sure to be
difficult. At the same time they knew that their
pursuers would not delay, and must be close behind
them. A hurried consultation was held, and it
was agreed that Kenton should swim the animals
over while Montgomery and Clark constructed a
raft to transport the baggage.</p>

<p>Accordingly Kenton led the animals into the
river, while he swam at their side, but the stream
had become so rough that he was forced away
from them, and all he could do was to save himself
from drowning. The horses being left to themselves
turned about and swam back to the shore they
had left a short time before.</p>

<p>This exasperating performance was repeated until
Kenton became so exhausted that he was forced
to lie down on the shore until he could recover his
strength and wind.</p>

<p>A council of war, as it might be called, was then
held and the question considered was whether they
should abandon the animals and attend to their
own safety, or risk their lives by waiting where
they were until the Ohio should become calmer, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
the hope of getting them to the other side. Nothing
can show the great admiration of the men of
the border for the noblest of all animals, than their
immediate and unanimous agreement that they
would never desert their horses.</p>

<p>The scouts committed the inexplainable blunder
of staying where they were, knowing, as they
must have known, that the infuriated warriors were
rapidly coming up on their trail, and could be at
no great distance behind them.</p>

<p>The wind continued churning the water all
through the day, and did not abate until the
next morning. Then, when they tried to force
the steeds into the water, they refused and some
of them broke away. The infatuated scouts lost
more valuable time in the vain attempt to recapture
them and, as was inevitable, the Indians soon
made their appearance.</p>

<p>They were in such numbers, and so well armed,
that it was useless to fight them, and Clark had
sense enough to take to his heels. He succeeded
in effecting his own escape. Montgomery was
shot down and scalped, while Kenton was seized
from behind, when on the very point of assailing a
warrior in front, and pinioned. Others speedily
gathered, beat and shook the scout, and pulled his
hair, until he was tortured almost to death.</p>

<p>"Steal hoss of Indian, eh!" they exclaimed
again and again as they beat him over the head
with their ramrods.</p>

<p>When they had pounded him until they were
tired, Kenton was thrown on his back, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
arms stretched out at full length. Pieces of saplings
were then fastened to his arms and legs in
such a manner that the poor fellow was literally
unable to stir hand or foot.</p>

<p>While thus engaged they continued to beat and
curse him in broken English. When he was strapped
in his immovable position he was left until
morning. No pen can picture the utter horror and
misery of such a night, with arm and legs outstretched
and with body incapable of any motion
excepting a slight turn of the head.</p>

<p>It was a literal crucifixion, without the erection
of the cross. Knowing the Indians so well, he did
not entertain a particle of doubt that he would be
put to death with the most fearful torture that can
be imagined.</p>

<p>The fury of the Indians against Kenton seemed
to increase rather than diminish. It would have
been a very easy matter to tomahawk or slay him
with knife or rifle, when he was so helpless, but that
would have ended the matter and deprived them
of the enjoyment they counted upon at such times.</p>

<p>In the morning they gave a Mazeppa performance,
by tying Kenton fast to an unbroken colt
and turning him loose. The horse, however,
seemed to have more pity than his cruel masters,
for after galloping a short distance about the
others, he came back and rejoined them, continuing
with the others until nightfall, when Kenton
was taken off and fastened by buffalo thongs
to the stakes of saplings as before.</p>

<p>For three days the terrible march continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
when the Indian town of Chillicothe was reached.
The arrival of the prisoner created great excitement,
and the chief Blackfish beat Kenton over
the naked shoulders with hickory sticks until the
blood flowed, and the poor fellow was almost delirious
with agony.</p>

<p>All the cries he heard during this fearful punishment
were those of fury. These soon changed to
a demand that he should be tied to the stake, and
it was done. His clothing was torn from his body,
his hands fastened above his head, and the Indians
danced about him beating and whooping and jeering
at the prisoner, who expected every minute
that the fire would be kindled at his feet.</p>

<p>Ordinarily this would have been done, but the
desire to continue the torture was so great that
the savages deferred the last awful tragedy, until
they should extract more sport from the victim.</p>

<p>He was kept in this trying position until late at
night, when he was released. It seemed as if it
were intended that Simon Kenton should go
through every form of Indian torture, for, on the
morrow, he was led out and forced to run the
gauntlet.</p>

<p>The preparations for this were so complete, and
the Indians so numerous with their clubs and all
sorts of weapons, that it can scarcely be doubted
that Kenton would have been beaten to death, had
he undertaken to speed the entire distance between
the two long rows of Indians.</p>

<p>Instead of doing so, he darted aside and after
doubling upon his pursuers, plunged into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
council house, receiving only a few blows from
the warriors standing near. Within this lodge
was held the council to determine what course
should be taken with their prisoner. There was
no thought or releasing him, but some might prefer
to delay the enjoyment of his death by torture no
longer, while others were inclined to think it was
too pleasant for them to allow the amusement to
terminate so soon.</p>

<p>A comparison of views and a ballot showed that
the majority were in favor of deferring his taking
off a short while longer. His execution, therefore,
was suspended for the time, and it was agreed to
take him to an Indian town on Mad River, known
as Waughcotomoco.</p>

<p>"What is to be done with me after we get there?"
asked Kenton of the renegade who interpreted the
sentence to him.</p>

<p>"Burn you at the stake," was the reply, accompanied
by a brutal oath, as the white savage strode
away.</p>

<p>Kenton was given back his clothing, and was
not bound while on the road, as it was deemed impossible
for him to escape from among his numerous,
vigilant captors.</p>

<p>But, as there could be no doubt that his death
by torture was fully determined, the prisoner was
resolved on one desperate effort to escape, for in
no sense could a failure result in making his condition
worse than before.</p>

<p>He deferred the attempt until they were so close
to Waughcotomoco, that the party exchanged signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
whoops with the warriors of the town who began
flocking thither to see the prisoner.</p>

<p>Feeling that it was then or never, Kenton uttered
a shout and broke away like a frightened deer,
the Indians following him, some on foot, and some
on horseback. His great fleetness might have enabled
him to escape, but while he was running
from those behind, he came directly upon a party
who were riding from the village to meet the
others, and before he was hardly aware of his danger
he was recaptured.</p>

<p>After suffering great indignities, they reached
Waughcotomoco, where Kenton was forced to run
the gauntlet again and was badly hurt. He was
then taken to the council-house, where he sat in
despair, while the warriors consulted as to the precise
means of his death.</p>

<p>While they were thus engaged, Simon Girty and
three companions came in with a white woman and
seven children as prisoners. Kenton was taken
away to make room for these, and as their fate now
became a matter of debate, the session was protracted
until a late hour. The verdict, however, was inevitable,
and on the morrow, Simon Girty, the notorious
renegade, gave himself the extreme pleasure of
communicating the news to the hapless prisoner.</p>

<p>During this interview Girty was astounded to discover
in the prisoner his former comrade, who had
served with him as a spy in Dunmore's expedition.
That was before Girty had foresworn his race, and
the two men became warmly attached to each other.</p>

<p>Girty was greatly agitated, and instantly set to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
work to secure the release of the prisoner. The
difficulty of this task can scarcely be imagined, for
such a request was unprecedented; but Girty persevered,
making the most ardent appeals and begging
and insisting, until it was put to a vote, when it was
agreed that the prayer, coming from one who had
served them so faithfully as had the renegade for
three years, could not be denied, and it was granted.</p>

<p>Kenton now remained a prisoner among the Indians
for three weeks, during which Girty treated
him with unvarying kindness. Indeed his conduct
in this extraordinary matter is the single bright
spot in the career of one of the most terrible
wretches that ever lived.</p>

<p>At the end of the time mentioned, however,
another council was held, and despite the strenuous
efforts of Girty, Kenton was condemned to death
at the stake. There now seemed no possible hope,
and, telling his friend he had done all he could for
him, Girty shook his hand and bade him good-by.</p>

<p>But Kenton's remarkable good fortune did not
desert him. The great chief Logan gave him
his friendship and did what he could to save him,
when Kenton was brought to his village, which was
a short distance away. His interference, however,
seemed to be unavailing, and he was started for
Sandusky under a strong escort, that being the
place fixed upon for his final death by torture.</p>

<p>There, however, when Kenton had abandoned
all hope, an Indian agent by the name of Drewyer
interested himself in his behalf, and by an ingenious
statagem secured his removal to Detroit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
He thus became a prisoner-of-war, as Detroit
was in the possession of the British, and his situation
was immeasurably improved. He was sure to
be treated in a civilized manner, and in process of
time would be set free.</p>

<p>The situation, however, was anything but agreeable
to Kenton, who was continually seeking for
some way of escape. None presented itself for a
long time, and he remained working for the garrison
on half-pay until the summer of 1779.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the longed-for opportunity
presented itself, through the kindness of
the wife of an Indian trader. Kenton knew well
enough that it would never do to plunge into the
wilderness without rifles and ammunition, and she
agreed to furnish him and two Kentuckians with
the indispensable articles.</p>

<p>It was no small task for a lady to secure three
guns and ammunition without the assistance of any
one, but she succeeded in doing so. In the early
summer of that year, the Indians around Detroit
engaged in one of their periodical carousals. It
was at night, and before giving themselves over to
their brutish indulgence they stacked their guns
near the house of the lady.</p>

<p>Without difficulty she secured three of the best,
and hid them in her garden. Previous to this she
had gathered some extra clothing and the required
ammunition, which were hidden in a hollow tree
outside the town. She managed to communicate
with Kenton, who, at the appointed time, appeared
at the garden with his friends, got the guns, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
thanking his preserver most fervently and receiving
her best wishes in return, bade her good-by and
hastened away with his companions.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in stealing out of town,
which was full of drunken Indians, but it never
would have done to wait; both they and the guns
would be missed in the morning, and search would
be immediately made.</p>

<p>The hollow tree was easily found, and hastily
equipping themselves with what was stored there,
they plunged into the wilderness and started on
their long and dangerous journey for Louisville,
Kentucky.</p>

<p>Leaving the commonly-traveled route, they first
headed for the prairies of the Wabash, and pushed
on like veteran pioneers who knew they were continually
in danger of pursuit. They lost no time
on the road, nor did they cease to use continual
vigilance.</p>

<p>They were over a month making their way
through the solitudes, but finally reached Louisville,
without accident, in the month of July, 1779.</p>

<p>Kenton had become so accustomed to his rough,
adventurous life, that he chafed under the quiet and
restraint of the town. Slinging his rifle over his
shoulder, therefore, he struck into the woods alone
and tramped to Vincennes to see his old friend,
Major Clark. He was warmly greeted, but he found
everything so dull and hum-drum that he re-entered
the wilderness, and after a long journey reached
Harrodsburg, where he was received with as much
delight as though he were Daniel Boone himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
In the famous expedition of General Clark against
the Indians, described elsewhere, Simon Kenton
commanded a company of volunteers from Harrod's
Station, and was one of the bravest officers of that
formidable campaign against the red men, whose
outrages were becoming so serious that the blow
was determined upon as a means of forcing them to
stay within their own lines.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the command of General
Clark numbered over a thousand men, and it
will be understood that it was the most effective
demonstration that, up to that time, had ever been
undertaken on the frontier. Chillicothe, Pickaway,
and numerous smaller towns were burnt and all the
crops destroyed.</p>

<p>It can well be believed that when they reached
Pickaway and the Indians made a stand, the arm
of Simon Kenton was nerved with tenfold power,
for it was there, two years before, that he had been
compelled to run the gauntlet and was beaten
almost to death. It was with the memory of the
terrible sufferings of that time that he led his company
into action, and he fought, as did they, like
Richard Cœur de Lion.</p>

<p>The warriors made a brave resistance, but were
unable to withstand the furious attack, and soon
were scattered like chaff, leaving their dead and
wounded on the field. This campaign brought
peace and quietness to the frontier during the following
two years. Kenton engaged in hunting, or
in assisting surveying parties, until 1782, when he
received the most startling news of his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
For eleven years he had been a wanderer in the
woods, oftentimes in indescribable peril, suffering
almost death over and over again, and never free
from the remorse caused by that encounter with his
rival so long before in Virginia, whom he believed
he left dying upon the ground and from whose presence
he fled like Cain from the vengeance of men.</p>

<p>But at the time mentioned Kenton received
proof that the man was not killed in that desperate
affray, but had recovered, and was then alive and
well, as was also the aged father of Kenton.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be conceived how great a burden
these tidings lifted from the heart of Simon Kenton,
who was no longer afraid to reveal his identity and
make inquiries about his friends. It was like entering
upon a new and joyous life.</p>

<p>Kenton commanded another company in General
Clark's campaign in the autumn of 1782, and, as
before, acted as the guide of the army, his knowledge
of the country and his consummate woodcraft
rendering his services indispensable in that direction.</p>

<p>While this campaign was only one of the numerous
similar ones which have marked the settlement
of the West, and which, sad to say, were too often
accompanied by overwhelming disaster, it was rendered
memorable to Kenton by a singular and impressive
engagement into which he entered.</p>

<p>It was when the army was on its return, when
opposite the mouth of the Licking, Nov. 4th, 1782,
that Captain McCracken, who was dying from a
wound received in battle, suggested that all the
pioneers of the expedition who might be living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
fifty years from that day, should meet on the spot
to celebrate the semi-centennial of the campaign.</p>

<p>It was at the suggestion of the dying soldier
that Colonel Floyd drew up the resolution, and the
meeting a half century later was agreed upon.</p>

<p>The purpose accomplished, the volunteers were
disbanded, and Kenton went back to Harrod's
Station, where he was always most gladly welcomed.</p>

<p>He had acquired considerable land, which was
rapidly increasing in value. With a few families he
began a settlement, which prospered greatly. The
soil was very fertile, they were industrious, and
they were blessed with abundant crops.</p>

<p>The circumstances being favorable, Kenton made
a journey to Virginia to visit his father and friends.
Thirteen years had passed since he had fled, believing
himself a murderer, and now, among the first to
take his hand, after he entered the familiar place,
was his former rival in love. He and his wife
greeted the handsome pioneer with great cordiality,
and all resentment was buried in the happiness of
the meeting.</p>

<p>Kenton was thankful indeed to find his aged father
in good health, though his mother had been dead
a number of years. Accompanied by his parent
and the rest of the family, he started for Kentucky,
intending that his father should spend the rest of
his days with him. Such was the case, indeed,
but the days proved fewer than the affectionate son
supposed they would be.</p>

<p>The parent was very feeble, and when Red Stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Fort was reached, he quietly died. He was buried
on the banks of the Monongahela, and Kenton,
with the remainder of the family, arrived at the
settlement in the winter of 1784.</p>

<p>Kentucky was rapidly filling up with emigrants
at this time, though, as is well known, the Indians
were very troublesome. Kenton saw that the land
was certain to become valuable, and he determined
to occupy the fertile section around his old camp
near Maysville, which he had occasion to remember
so well.</p>

<p>He made the venture in the summer of 1784,
with a company of pioneers; but the Indians were
so dangerous that they were forced to retire for the
time. A few months later Kenton went back with
a few friends, built a block-house, and soon after
was joined by several families.</p>

<p>Settlers continued to flock thither, and the country
prospered, despite the hostility of the red men.
Kenton, by his foresight, had secured the right and
title to a large quantity of valuable land. One
thousand acres of this he gave to Arthur Fox and
William Wood, and on it they laid out the town of
Washington.</p>

<p>Despite the severe blow administered by General
Clark, the savages committed so many depredations
that a retaliatory campaign was determined upon.
Seven hundred volunteers gathered under Colonel
Logan and invaded the Indian country, inflicting
much damage, and returning with only a trifling loss.</p>

<p>The guide of this expedition was Simon Kenton,
who also commanded a company; but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
scarcely home again when the Indians renewed
their depredations with such persistency that Kenton
appealed to his old friends to rally once more,
and to "carry the war into Africa."</p>

<p>It was promptly done, he assuming the part of captain
and of guide as before. Chillicothe was burned,
and the expedition returned without losing a man.</p>

<p>By this time Kenton was acknowledged as the
leader in the frontier settlement. He possessed a
great deal of valuable land, was a master of woodcraft,
and in all the troubles with the Indians was
looked to for protection and assistance.</p>

<p>During the half-dozen years following, his services
in the latter respect were beyond estimate. He
demonstrated his skill in the ways of the woods by
ambushing a party of dusky marauders who had
come down to devastate the border, and by inflicting
such severe loss that the others fled in
terror and never attempted to molest the settlement
again.</p>

<p>But this period will be recognized by the reader
as the eventful one of General Anthony Wayne's
expedition against the combined Indian tribes of
the West. Disaster had followed disaster, until
the United States Government saw the necessity of
ending the troubles by a campaign which should
be resistless, and crushing in its effects.</p>

<p>Simon Kenton, at the time of Wayne's expedition,
was a major, and with his battalion he joined
the forces at Greenville. It may be said that his
reputation at that time was national, and he was
recognized as one of the most skillful and intrepid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
pioneers of the West. His bravery, activity and
knowledge of "wood lore," inspired confidence
everywhere, and linked his name inseparably with
the settlement of the West.</p>

<p>His foresight in taking up the valuable lands was
now shown by the results. They appreciated so
rapidly in value with the settlement and development
of the country, that he became one of the
wealthiest settlers in Kentucky.</p>

<p>But singularly (and yet perhaps it was not singular
either), the same misfortune overtook him
that befell Daniel Boone and so many others of the
pioneers.</p>

<p>The rapacious speculators, by their superior cunning,
got all his land away from him, until he was
not worth a farthing. Worse than that they
brought him in debt, and his body was taken upon
the covenants in deeds to lands, which he had in
point of fact given away. He was imprisoned for
a full year on the very spot where he built his
cabin in 1775, and planted the first corn planted
north of the Kentucky River by a white man,
and where for many a time he had braved hunger,
death, and undergone suffering in its most frightful
forms.</p>

<p>He was literally reduced to beggary by the cruel
rapacity of the land sharks, and in 1802 he removed
to Ohio and settled in Urbana. Kenton's
remarkable sweetness of character, despite the fact
that he was one of the most terrible of Indian
fighters, was such that he scarcely ever uttered a
word of complaint. No man had endured more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
than he for Kentucky and Ohio, and no one had
ever been treated more shabbily; yet he loved the
"Dark and Bloody Ground" none the less.</p>

<p>His services and his ability were appreciated to
that extent in Ohio that he was elected a brigadier-general
of militia, three years after his removal to
the State. Five years later, that is, in 1810, he
was converted and joined the Methodist Episcopal
Church.</p>

<p>Reverend J.&nbsp;B. Finley, the well known missionary
of the West, relates that his father and
Kenton met at a camp meeting on the Mad River.
They were old friends and the interview was a
most pleasant one. The meeting was accompanied
by a great awakening, during which Kenton took
the elder Finley aside and told him how deeply his
heart had been touched, how much he was impressed
with his own sinfulness, and how desirous
he was of obtaining divine pardon.</p>

<p>He bound the minister to keep the whole matter
a secret, and the two knelt down in prayer in the
woods. Kenton was speedily converted, and springing
to his feet, ran shouting back to camp meeting,
with the minister panting after him.</p>

<p>The old Indian fighter outran his pastor, and
when Mr. Finley reached his congregation, the
other had gathered a great crowd about him, and,
with a glowing face, was telling the news of his
conversion.</p>

<p>"I thought this was to be a secret," called out
Mr. Finley, "and here, General, you are proclaiming
it to every one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
"It's too glorious to keep," was the reply of
Kenton.</p>

<p>He continued a devout and humble Christian
for the rest of his life. His voice was remarkably
sweet and musical, and he was fond of singing.
He took part in many religious exercises and
meetings, and entered into the service of his divine
Master with the same ardor he had shown in that of
his country, during his early and mature manhood.</p>

<p>In 1813, Kenton joined the Kentucky troops
under Governor Shelby, with whose family he was
a great favorite. He was then nearly threescore
years of age, but he was rugged, strong, and as
patriotic as ever. He took part in the battle of
the Thames, fighting with the same bravery that
was natural to him from boyhood.</p>

<p>It was the last engagement in which he bore a
hand, and respecting it the following incident is
worthy of note:</p>

<p>In the month of May, 1881, Ayres Lefargee, who
died at Poplar Plain, Kentucky, was buried at
Decatur, Illinois. He was a soldier of the war of
1812, in the fourth regiment of Kentucky troops
under Governor Shelby, and was present at the battle
of the Thames in which the great Shawanoe
chieftain Tecumseh was killed. After the battle
he went with Captain Matthews and Simon Kenton
to the spot where the chief fell. "Turn the
body over," said Kenton, and, upon Lefargee doing
so, they found seven bullet-holes in it. Lefargee
always claimed that Tecumseh was killed by a soldier
named Dave Gealding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
This question has never been satisfactorily settled,
though the claim of Colonel Richard M. Johnson
seems as good as that of any one. His horse
had fallen, and while he was endeavoring to extricate
himself, a distinguished looking Indian who,
it was claimed by many that knew him, was Tecumseh,
made a rush for Colonel Johnson.</p>

<p>"I didn't stop to ask him his name," said Colonel
Johnson, when questioned about it afterwards,
"for there was no time for explanations, but I fired,
when, had I waited five seconds longer, he would
have brained me with his upraised tomahawk."</p>

<p>The war of 1812 finished, Kenton returned to
the obscurity of his humble cabin, where he lived
until 1820, when he removed to the headwaters of
Mad River, Logan county, Ohio, near the very
spot where, many years before, he had been tied to
the stake by the Indians, when they condemned
him to death.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible for the old pioneer to escape
the annoyance of the land-sharpers. He was
still the owner of many large mountain tracts of
Kentucky, but he was "land poor," in its fullest
sense, and these were forfeited for taxes.</p>

<p>Kenton became so worn out, and so distressed
by poverty, that in 1824, when nearly seventy years
old, he rode to Frankfort, while the Legislature was
in session, to petition that body to release these
comparatively worthless lands from the claims
upon them for unpaid taxes.</p>

<p>The old hunter was clothed in dilapidated garments,
and his rickety horse looked so woe-begone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
that the wonder was how he could carry such a
large man as he was. But when it became known
that Simon Kenton was in town, it caused an
excitement like that which the arrival of the
menagerie and circus excites.</p>

<p>There was no one in the capital of Kentucky
who had not heard of the wonderful exploits of
Kenton, and the tall handsome figure of the hunter,
with his mild prepossessing features, would
have attracted attention anywhere. It was hard
to believe that this old gentleman with his gentle
blue eyes, his soft musical voice, and his humble
Christian bearing, was the hurricane-like fighter, who
had torn the reeking scalp from the head of the
fierce savage, who had run the gauntlet more than
once, who had trailed the red Indian through the
gloomy depths of the forest and who had lived in
the wilderness in storm and sunshine, week after
week and month after month, when he never closed
his eyes with certainty he would not be awakened
for an instant by the crash of the tomahawk as it
clove his skull in twain.</p>

<p>But this was Simon Kenton, and the crowds began
to gather. General Thomas Fletcher recognized
him and donned him in a good respectable
suit of clothing. Then he was taken to the Capitol
and placed in the Speaker's chair, where the multitude,
in which were the legislators and the most
prominent citizens, filed through the building, and
were introduced to the great adventurer, who smilingly
shook their hands, exchanged a few pleasant
words, and blushed like a school boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
It was the proudest day of Simon Kenton's life,
and he had every reason to look back to it with
delight, for it resulted in substantial benefit to him.</p>

<p>His presence called up so vividly the great services
he had rendered the State, and the burning
injustice he had suffered, that the legislators at
once released all his lands from the tax claims, and
shortly after, through the exertions of Judge Burnet
and General Vance, of Congress, a pension of
two hundred and forty dollars a year was obtained
for the old hero, who was thus secured against
want for the remainder of his life.</p>

<p>Kenton now lived a quiet life, serene and hopeful,
and quietly contemplating the end which he
knew was close at hand. He was held in the
greatest respect and the strongest affection by his
numerous friends, while Kentucky itself felt a pride
in the brave hunter, scout and pioneer.</p>

<p>It will be remembered by the reader, that on the
4th of November, 1782, Simon Kenton became a
party to an agreement of singular and romantic
interest.</p>

<p>During the expedition of General Clark against
the Indian towns, Kenton as usual acted as guide
to the army, which numbered fifteen hundred men.
On the return of the force, the pioneers which
composed it came to a halt, opposite the Licking,
and held a conference. Captain McCracken, of the
Kentucky Light Horse, had received a slight wound
in the arm while fighting, and which caused him
little concern at the time. But a virulent mortification
had set in, and it became evident to all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
he had but a short time to live. At his suggestion,
Colonel Floyd brought forward the resolution by
which the pioneers who might survive agreed to
meet on that same spot, a half century later, to
talk over old times.</p>

<p>The meeting was held in the unbroken wilderness,
abounding with its game and with the fierce
red man; and the pioneers were in the flush and
vigor of young manhood, with many years of hard,
perilous service before them. They all felt that
such as should be spared to see the closing of the
half century before them, would witness changes
and developments in their beloved country, such as
awed the imagination when it attempted to grasp it.</p>

<p>On that lonely spot, where McCracken closed his
eyes and was laid mournfully away in his last long
rest by his brave brother pioneers, was the heart
of the magnificently growing West. His grave was
in sight of the beautiful Queen city, and the howling
wilderness now blossomed as the rose.</p>

<p>As the semi-centennial approached, it was looked
forward to with a strong interest by the survivors,
who were found to be quite numerous. The lives
which these hardy pioneers led were conducive to
longevity, provided always the wild Indians afforded
the opportunity and failed to cut them off in their
prime.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>As the semi-centennial approached, Simon
Kenton, who had passed his fourscore, was deeply
solicitous lest he should not be able to be present.
He was desirous that every survivor should be at
the gathering, and published an address in which
he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Fellow Citizens</i>:&mdash;Being one of the first, after Colonel Daniel
Boone, who aided in the conquest of Kentucky and the West, I am
called upon to address you. My heart melts on such an occasion;
I look forward to the contemplated meeting with melancholy
pleasure; it has caused tears to flow in copious showers.
I wish to see once more before I die, my few surviving friends.
My solemn promise, made fifty years ago, binds me to meet them.
I ask not for myself; but you may find in our assembly some
who have never received any pay or pension, who have sustained
the cause of their country equal to any other service, and who in
the decline of their life are poor. Then, you prosperous sons of
the West, forget not those old and gray-headed veterans on this
occasion; let them return to their families with some little manifestations
of your kindness to cheer their hearts.</p>

<p>"I may add my prayer: may kind Heaven grant us a clear
sky, fair and pleasant weather, a safe journey, and a happy meeting
and a smile upon us and our families, and bless us and our
nation on the approaching occasion.</p>

<p class="p0 sigright">
"SIMON KENTON.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
The year 1832 will be recognized as the terrible
cholera season, when the pestilence smote the land
and the whole country was in mourning. Men
shrank appalled as the multitudes sank on their
right and left, and business for the time was paralyzed
by the awful scourge which swept from one
end of the land to the other.</p>

<p>Cincinnati was shrouded in deepest gloom by the
ravages of the fearful disease, yet when the anniversary
came round a large number of the old
pioneers met, and the Corporation voted them a
dinner.</p>

<p>General Simon Kenton, in spite of his anxiety to
be present, was unable to appear, owing to his
feebleness and indisposition of body. His absence
was greatly mourned, for he would have been the
prince of all that noble band, could his venerable
form have appeared among them.</p>

<p>With Kenton the sunset of life was as quiet and
serene as the close of a summer day. In the month
of April, 1836, he quietly died in his home, surrounded
by his affectionate family, friends and
neighbors, and supported by the sublime faith of
the meek, devout Christian, who joyfully approaches
the dark river and launches out for the other shore.</p>

by Four Indians, and Kills Three&mdash;Escape

<p>When one reads of the early days of the great
West and of the tornado-like encounters in which
the borderers engaged, he finds that there are few
more prominent figures than that of Lewis Wetzel,
who was born on the Big Wheeling, Virginia, about
the year 1764. He had four brothers, Martin,
Jacob, John and George, and two sisters, Susan and
Christina. Martin was the only brother who exceeded
Lewis in age.</p>

<p>The home of the Wetzels exposed them to perils
from the Indians, for it will be recognized by the
reader as a spot peculiarly open to assaults from the
red men.</p>

<p>This was proven by the terrible fate that overtook
the family. One day the Indians suddenly appeared
and made a fierce attack upon the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Several of the smaller children were absent, and
during the excitement the mother succeeded in
getting away; but the old man was killed and
scalped, and Lewis, then thirteen years old, and
his brother Jacob, two years younger, were taken
away prisoners.</p>

<p>In the fight, Lewis received a slight wound from
a bullet, but it did not incapacitate him from traveling,
and on the second night after the capture the
Indians encamped on the Big Lick, twenty miles
distant from the river, in what is now Ohio, and
upon the waters of McMahon's Creek.</p>

<p>The prisoners were so young that the captors
were justified in considering them of little account,
and they did not take the trouble to bind them
when they stopped for the night. Lewis, however,
was old enough to watch for a chance to get away,
and when sure all the Indians were asleep, he
touched his brother and whispered to him to make
ready to follow him.</p>

<p>They made their way out of the camp without
difficulty, but had not proceeded far when they
stopped.</p>

<p>"I don't like the idea of going home barefooted,"
said Lewis, "you stay here while I go back and get
a pair of moccasins for you and a pair for me."</p>

<p>The daring lad succeeded in obtaining the necessary
articles and soon rejoined his brother; but as
they were about to start on again he expressed his
dissatisfaction that they had no weapons.</p>

<p>"We can't get along without a gun; wait here a
little longer and I'll bring one back."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
And young Lewis did as he said he would. Now
that each had a pair of moccasins, and the elder
carried a good rifle, they were prepared for travel,
and they plunged into the woods at once.</p>

<p>Lewis Wetzel displayed a knowledge of woodcraft
on this occasion which was wonderful in
one so young. He discovered the trail and followed
it back without difficulty, and knowing he
would be pursued, he kept such unremitting watch
that he detected the approach of the Indians,
and he and his brother hid in the bushes until they
passed.</p>

<p>When they were out of sight, the brothers came
back to the trail and followed after the Indians. It
did not take the latter very long to find they had
gone beyond the lads, and they turned about to
find them.</p>

<p>But, as before, Lewis was on the watch, and he
and his brother eluded them. Shortly after they
discovered that two of the warriors were mounted
and in hot chase after them; but Lewis gave them
the slip in the same skilful manner, and reaching
Wheeling the next day, they constructed a raft and
crossed the river.</p>

<p>When they came to the ruins of their home and
found that their father had been killed and scalped,
they were so infuriated that they took a vow to kill
every Indian that was in their power to kill, so long
as they should live.</p>

<p>Such is the account as generally given, though a
different version is entitled to equal credence. This
says that the elder Wetzel was shot, in 1787, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
paddling a canoe near Captina, on his return from
Middle Island Creek, and that young Lewis received
his first wound while standing in the door of
his own home. Be that as it may, there can be no
doubt that he and his brother took the barbarous
oath as stated, and it is equally a matter of history
that they carried it out in spirit and letter.</p>

<p>Martin Wetzel acted the part of a wild beast
and committed acts for which no law human or
divine can find justification. No red Indian ever
showed greater perfidy than did he. During
Colonel Brodhead's expedition in 1780, Martin
Wetzel was a volunteer. An Indian messenger,
under promise of protection, came into camp and
held an interview with Brodhead. While they
were talking in the most friendly manner, Martin
Wetzel stole up behind the unsuspecting red man,
and quickly drawing a tomahawk, which he had
hidden in his hunting-shirt, struck the Indian in the
back of the head a blow which stretched him lifeless
on the ground.</p>

<p>Colonel Brodhead was exasperated at the atrocious
act, yet he dared not punish Wetzel, for
three-fourths of the army would have rallied in his
defence.</p>

<p>In the life of Daniel Boone we gave an account
of the campaign of Colonel Crawford in 1782.
Lewis Wetzel served as a volunteer, being no more
than eighteen years of age. The campaign was one
of the most frightful disasters that ever occurred in
the West, Colonel Crawford being captured and
burned to death at the stake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Among the disorganized soldiers who managed
to escape the terrible vengeance of the red men,
was one named Mills, who reached a spring some
nine miles from Wheeling, where he was forced to
leave his horse and go the rest of the way on foot.
From Wheeling he proceeded to Van Meter's fort,
where he fell in with Lewis Wetzel, whom he
persuaded to go back with him in quest of his
horse.</p>

<p>Wetzel cautioned him against the danger, but
Mills was determined, and the two made their
way back to the spring, where they saw the horse
standing tied to a sapling. The scout knew what
this meant, but the sight of his animal drew Mills
forward, and running up to the tree, he began untying
him. Before he could finish, there was a
discharge of rifles from the wood, and Mills fell
fatally wounded.</p>

<p>Knowing that the warriors were all around him,
the fleet-footed Wetzel bounded off like a deer,
with four of the swiftest runners speeding after
him. The chase was a terrific one, and after a half
mile, one of the Indians came so close that the
fugitive, believing he was on the point of throwing
his tomahawk, suddenly whirled about and shot
him dead, resuming his flight with the same desperate
exertion as before.</p>

<p>The art of reloading his gun while on a dead run
had been practised by Wetzel, until he could do
the difficult feat with ease. Never was there more
urgent need of that peculiar skill than on the
present occasion, for at the end of another half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
mile, a second Indian was so close that Wetzel
turned to fire.</p>

<p>Before he could do so, the warrior grasped the
end of the barrel, and as he was immensely powerful
and active, he brought Wetzel to his knees, and
came within a hair's-breadth of wrenching the
weapon from his grasp. The white man, however,
during the fierce struggle, managed to get the
muzzle of the gun turned toward the savage, when
he pulled the trigger, killing him instantly.</p>

<p>The struggle was very brief, but during its continuance
the other two Indians had approached so
nigh, that Wetzel bounded away again at the
highest bent of his speed and soon had his rifle reloaded.
Then he slackened his pace, so as to allow
them to come up, but they were suspicious of
the white man who always seemed to have a
charged rifle at his service, and they held back.
Then Wetzel stopped and they did the same.
Several times he wheeled about and raised his gun,
when they immediately dodged behind trees. One
of them did not conceal his body perfectly, and
Wetzel fired, wounding him badly. The remaining
warrior ran for life, shouting: "<i>Dat white man's
gun am always loaded!</i>"</p>

<p>Actuated by that intense hate of the Indians
which marked the career of Lewis Wetzel and
several of his brothers, there was but the single
thought of revenge which inspired the muscular
arm to deeds as savage as the red man himself ever
engaged in. While General Harmar was doing his
utmost to establish peace with the Indians, Lewis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Wetzel and a companion hid themselves near the
fort, and, in pure wantonness, the former fired upon
a warrior who was riding by. He was so badly
wounded that he was barely able to reach the fort,
where he died that night.</p>

<p>General Harmar was so indignant over the murder,
which Wetzel unblushingly avowed, that he sent
Captain Kingsbury and a squad of men with orders
to take Wetzel dead or alive. All considerations
called for the prompt punishment of the murderer,
but his capture was an impossibility, inasmuch as
he possessed the fullest sympathy of the frontiersmen,
who would have rallied to a man in his defence.</p>

<p>When Captain Kingsbury reached the Mingo
Bottom, and his errand became known, Lewis
Wetzel and a large number of equally reckless
companions formed a plan for attacking the party
and massacring every one of them. Only by the
interference of Major M'Mahan, who persuaded the
Captain of his danger and induced him to withdraw,
was the crime averted.</p>

<p>Sometime later, however, Wetzel was seized
while asleep in a cabin, put in irons and carried to
the guard-house. He was greatly humiliated by
the shame of being handcuffed, and sent for General
Harmar, to whom he made the characteristic
proposal that he should release him among the
large party of Indians who were around the fort,
and allow him to fight it out with them. This of
course was declined by the officer, who, however,
consented to knock off his irons, but kept on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
the handcuffs, allowing him to walk about the
fort.</p>

<p>After Wetzel had loosened his limbs by some
moderate exercise, he suddenly made a break for
the woods and was soon among them. He was
fired upon by the guards, and General Harmar instantly
sent a number of his fleetest runners, including
several Indians, in pursuit.</p>

<p>They almost captured him too, for a couple of
the warriors sat down on the log, under which he
was crouching, and Wetzel afterwards said that his
great fear was that his position would be betrayed
by the tumultuous throbbing of his heart. The
next day he came across a friend who released him
from his handcuffs, furnished him with a gun and
ammunition, and Wetzel paddled down the river
for Kentucky, where he could feel safe from General
Harmar.</p>

<p>The latter issued a proclamation offering a large
reward for the capture of Wetzel, but no frontiersman
ever made the dangerous attempt to take him,
and soon after he joined a party of scouts under
Major M'Mahan. They numbered twenty men,
and were organized to punish the Indians for murdering
a family in the Mingo Bottom. One of the
inducements for enlisting was the offer of a hundred
dollars to the man who should bring in the
first Indian scalp.</p>

<p>The scouts had not penetrated far into the hostile
country, when they suddenly found themselves in
the presence of a large war party. A hasty consultation
was held and it was deemed best to withdraw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
but Wetzel refused to return until he should
accomplish something. He announced that he
would never be seen at home until he lost his own
scalp or brought that of an Indian with him.</p>

<p>It was a dangerous task he had taken on himself,
but he persevered and spent several days in prowling
through the woods, hunting for the coveted opportunity.
At last he found a couple of warriors
encamped by themselves, and he watched by them
until the night was far advanced. Finally one of
them got up and moved away, taking a torch with
him, doubtless with the intention of watching a
deer lick. Wetzel was so anxious to kill both
savages that he waited until daylight for the return
of the other.</p>

<p>He did not show himself, however, and unwilling
to wait longer, the merciless white man
stole up to where the sleeping warrior lay and slew
him with one furious blow of his knife.</p>

<p>Wetzel reached his home without difficulty and
received the one hundred dollars reward for the
murder.</p>

<p>A singular occurrence took place shortly after
this. From the fort at Wheeling, there had been
heard on several occasions, cries such as would be
made by a wounded turkey, and more than once
some of the men had crossed over to ascertain
the cause. The fact that several soldiers were
never seen again, did not arouse a suspicion of the
real explanation in the minds of any one excepting
that of Lewis Wetzel.</p>

<p>He concluded to make an investigation for himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Cautiously stealing around in the direction of
the sound, he approached a deep cavern, the mouth
of which was some twenty yards above the river.
From this crept forth an Indian warrior, who uttered
the peculiar call that had lured so many to
their death. Wetzel waited until he gained a fair
sight of the savage, when he took careful aim
and the decoy never uttered his deceptive signal
again.</p>

<p>Wetzel supposed that his trouble with General
Harmar would gradually die out with the lapse of
time, but the commander had issued standing
orders to his officers to arrest him wherever and
whenever he could be found. On his way down
the river toward Kenawha, Wetzel landed at Point
Pleasant, where he roamed about the town with
perfect unconcern. While doing so he unexpectedly
came face to face with Lieutenant Kingsbury,
who had set out to capture him once before.</p>

<p>Wetzel expected a desperate encounter with
him, and braced himself for the attack; but Kingsbury,
who was personally brave, saluted him with
the order to get out of his sight, and passed on.
Wetzel thought it wise to leave the neighborhood,
and, taking to his canoe, he put off for Limestone,
which place, and the county town, Washington,
he made his headquarters for a considerable time
after.</p>

<p>His skill with the rifle, and his reckless bravery,
could not fail to render him a great favorite among
the rough men of the border. Could his capture
have been arranged with perfect safety to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
concerned, it is not probable that any one could
have been induced to undertake it.</p>

<p>One day Wetzel was sitting in a tavern in Maysville,
when Lieutenant Lawler of the regular army,
who was going down the Ohio to Fort Washington
with a number of soldiers, landed and discovered
him. Without a moment's unnecessary delay, he
ordered out a file of soldiers, took Wetzel aboard
the boat, and before the citizens had time to rally,
he was delivered to General Harmar at Cincinnati.</p>

<p>The General placed him in irons again, preparatory
to his trial for the killing of the Indian, and
then followed a scene of extraordinary excitement.
Petitions for the release of Wetzel poured in upon
General Harmar from every quarter, and the indignation
became so great that mutterings of a
general uprising were soon heard. Serious trouble
for a time threatened, for passions were roused to
a high pitch, and the intensity deepened as the
time for the trial approached.</p>

<p>Finally Judge Symmes issued a writ of habeas
corpus in the case, and abundant security being
furnished, Wetzel was released. He was escorted
in triumph to Columbia, where he was treated to
a grand supper, including the usual speeches and
congratulations, and where no doubt he concluded
his friends were right in looking upon him as a
model of heroism and chivalry to whom it was an
honor to do homage.</p>

<p>Lewis Wetzel hunted Indians as most men hunt
the deer and buffalo. He looked upon the red
man as legitimate game, and many a time has he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
slung his rifle over his shoulder and plunged into
the woods for the express purpose of bringing
down one of the race against which he had vowed
eternal vengeance.</p>

<p>Numerous of his barbarous exploits must remain
unrecorded, and well would it be could the necessity
never arise for a history of any of them, for
they do not show the character of an undoubtedly
brave man in an attractive light.</p>

<p>Late one autumn he started out on one of his
sanguinary hunts and directed his steps toward the
Muskingum River. He had not tramped long
when he discovered a camp where four Indians
had established themselves for the winter. Not
dreaming of any danger, the red men, contrary to
their custom, had not taken their usual precautions,
and kept neither watch nor sentinels.</p>

<p>This was a tempting opportunity, but a single
white hunter, no matter how daring and skillful,
might well hesitate before attacking four athletic
and well-armed warriors; but the hesitation of
Lewis Wetzel was caused only by the necessity for
reflecting on the best course to be pursued.</p>

<p>He decided to make his attack on the four in
the dead of night when all were sound asleep. He
therefore waited patiently in the gloom until he
saw they were wrapped in profound slumber. Then
he stole forward, and with his dreadful knife, dispatched
three in quick succession, but the fourth
darted into the woods and escaped in the darkness.</p>

<p>It was near Wheeling, while he was engaged on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
one of his numerous scouts, that he came upon a
deserted cabin. It was raining at the time, and he
was glad to use the place as a shelter. A few
pieces of boards were gathered together in the loft
and used as a bed, but before he fell asleep, six Indians
entered and started a fire, with a view of
preparing their evening meal.</p>

<p>Had the scout been asleep when they entered
they would have been certain to discover him by
his heavy breathing, and as it was, Wetzel scarcely
saw how he could escape detection. So he grasped
his knife and held himself ready for the desperate
encounter which was certain to follow such a discovery.</p>

<p>The Indians, however, did not dream of the
presence of the human tiger that was glaring down
upon them from the loft above, and soon the half
dozen were unconscious in sleep. Feeling that his
quarters were dangerous, Wetzel cautiously stole
out during the darkness and hid himself behind a
log which commanded the front of the cabin.</p>

<p>In the morning the first warrior who presented
himself at the door was shot dead. Before the
others could comprehend what had taken place the
murderer was fleeing like a deer through the woods,
and was soon safe from all danger of pursuit.</p>

<p>Such exploits as these increased the popularity
of Wetzel, while the attempts made by General
Harmar to punish him for his crimes deepened the
dislike felt toward him for what was regarded as
his unjust persecution of a worthy man.</p>

<p>Not long after the Indian-killer accepted the invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
of a relative to visit him on Dunkard
Creek. It was some distance away, and the two
men pursued their walk through the woods at a
leisurely pace, talking of their hunting adventures,
chatting like a couple of school-boys, and with no
thought of impending trouble.</p>

<p>But when they emerged from the forest into the
clearing where the home of the relative stood, a
most startling sight met their eyes.</p>

<p>The house was a mass of smoking ruins. The
Indians had been there and left this proof of their
ferocity. Wetzel carefully examined the trail and
found that the party numbered three warriors and
one white man, and that they had taken off a single
prisoner.</p>

<p>The last was the betrothed of the relative of the
scout, and, as may well be supposed, he was wild
with excitement and fury and determined to pursue
them without an instant's delay. But Wetzel
argued him into something like calmness, and he
saw the necessity of placing himself under the control
of such a wonderfully skillful woodman as was
his companion.</p>

<p>The wish of Wetzel was to overtake the party
before they reached the Ohio, though there could
be no certainty as to how much start the red men
had gained. It was soon seen, however, that they
anticipated pursuit, for they had taken the greatest
pains to hide their trail. They might have succeeded
in the case of ordinary pursuers, but it was
impossible to conceal the faint but unerring signs
from the keen eye of Wetzel, who pushed forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
on their path like the bloodhound tracking its victim
through thicket and morass.</p>

<p>It soon became certain that the savages were
making for the river, and feeling quite sure of the
particular crossing they would seek, Wetzel left the
trail altogether, and with his friend hastened to the
same place.</p>

<p>It was a long distance, but the hunters for the
time were tireless, never throwing away a single
minute. As it was reasonable to believe that the
Indians would take a short route to the stream, it
can be understood that the pursuers could not
hope to gain much in the race after all.</p>

<p>When night settled over the great wilderness,
they were still a good distance from the Ohio.
They stopped for a brief while until they could
swallow a few mouthfuls of food. Then they
hastened on again guided by the stars overhead.
But even this help was soon taken from them by
the heavy clouds which overspread the sky, and
shut out the slightest twinkling orb in the firmament.</p>

<p>It was useless to seek to go any further, when,
with all their cunning, they could not prevent themselves
from losing their bearings and most likely
going directly back upon the true course.</p>

<p>So they halted where they were, until it began
to grow light in the East, when they resumed
their hurried journey. They had not gone far before
they struck the trail again, and one of the first
tracks recognized was the imprint of the small shoe
worn by the affianced of the young man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
The Indians, however, were still far ahead, and
though the two hunters pushed forward with all
the energy possible, they caught no sight of the
enemy, as hour after hour passed away.</p>

<p>But Wetzel was convinced they were gaining,
and both were in high hope, for as the afternoon
wore to its close, they recognized from the signs
around them that they were in the neighborhood
of the Ohio, and undoubtedly were close upon the
Indians and their captive.</p>

<p>The night had fairly set in when they reached
the river side, and they caught the glimmer of the
camp-fire of those on the other shore, just below
the mouth of the Captina. Cautiously the two
pursuers entered the river and swam across. A few
minutes spent in reconnoissance enabled them to locate
each member of the party, including the captive.</p>

<p>The sight of the young lady drove her betrothed
almost frantic, and he insisted on attacking the
marauders at once; but Wetzel, who was as cool
and collected as though no enemy was within a
dozen miles, would not permit it.</p>

<p>"The first hour of daybreak is the time," said
he, "and nothing shall be done until then." His
companion had no choice but to obey, though it
drove him to madness to remain so near his beloved,
without striking a blow in her behalf.</p>

<p>The long wearisome hours passed slowly, and at
last it began to grow light in the East. The young
man was quivering with excitement, but Wetzel
had been engaged in too many terrific encounters
to lose his self-possession at such a critical time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
The red men are early risers, when on the march,
and as soon as it began to grow light in the East,
they were astir. Wetzel directed his friend to take
sure aim at the renegade, pledging him that he
would attend to the Indians.</p>

<p>They fired simultaneously, and each brought
down his man. The lover dashed into camp to
his affianced, while the two warriors ran among the
trees until they could learn the strength of the
attacking party. The dauntless Wetzel followed
as impetuously as though he had an entire company
at his back.</p>

<p>As was his custom, he reloaded on the run, and
after a short pursuit, fired his gun at random, so
as to draw out the savages. It produced the effect,
for the warriors, supposing him to be defenceless,
came rushing forth, with uplifted tomahawks
and whooping in triumph; but Wetzel took but a
few seconds to reload his gun, when he shot the
nearest through the body.</p>

<p>As there could be no doubt that his rifle was now
unloaded, the single remaining Indian made for
him with the fury of a panther. Wetzel, who was
no less active and athletic, dodged from tree to tree
and ran here and there, baffling the fatal tomahawk
that was on the point of being hurled more than
once, until his terrible rifle was ready again, when
he wheeled and brought down the Indian, who
must have wondered in his last moments at the
wonderful gun carried by the white man.</p>

<p>While Lewis Wetzel was engaged in these extraordinary
forays, several of his brothers were scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
less active. As they were inspired by the same
intense hate which nerved the arms of the more
famous scout, it will be readily conceded that the
murder of the elder Wetzel years before by the
Indians was repaid with more than interest.</p>

<p>After Lewis had roamed through the wilderness
some time longer, he concluded to make a journey
to the extreme south, and for that purpose engaged
on a flat-boat bound for New Orleans.
While in that city he got into some serious difficulty,
the precise nature of which is unknown.
The result was he suffered imprisonment for two
years. It is not improbable that he discovered the
difference between breaking the law in the Western
wilderness and in the Crescent City.</p>

<p>He finally found his way back to Wheeling,
where he resumed his roaming through the woods,
and soon became involved in his characteristic
adventures with the red men.</p>

<p>He was returning one day from a hunt, when
happening to look up, he observed a warrior in the
very act of leveling his gun at him. Quick as a
flash Wetzel dodged behind a tree, the Indian
doing the same, and they stood facing each other
for a considerable time.</p>

<p>Growing impatient of waiting, the scout resorted
to the oft-described trick of placing his cap on the
end of his ramrod and projecting it a short distance
beyond the trunk. This brought the fire of the
savage, and before he could reload the white man
shot him.</p>

<p>Wetzel was known so generally as a daring and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
skillful scout, that General Clarke, while organizing
his celebrated expedition to the country beyond the
Rocky Mountains, used his utmost effort to secure
him as a member of the company. Wetzel was
not inclined to go, but he was finally persuaded,
and when they started, he was one of the most
valuable members. He kept with them for three
months and then turned about and came home.</p>

<p>Some time later he left on a flat-boat, and went
to the house of a relative, near Natchez, where he
died in the summer of 1808.</p>

<p>"Dickens as a novelist and prose poet is to be classed in the front rank of
the noble company to which he belongs. He has revived the novel of genuine

but at the same time has given to his material an individual coloring

exemplars, constitute a world of their own, whose truth to nature every
reader instinctively recognizes in connection with their truth to darkness."&mdash;<i>E.

<blockquote>

<p>This work, which is prepared in elegant style, and profusely illustrated,
is a comprehensive description of England and Wales, arranged in convenient
form for the tourist, and at the same time providing an illustrated
guide-book to a country which Americans always view with interest. There
are few satisfactory works about this land which is so generously gifted by
Nature and so full of memorials of the past. Such books as there are, either
cover a few counties or are devoted to special localities, or are merely guide-books.
The present work is believed to be the first attempt to give in attractive
form a description of the stately homes, renowned castles, ivy-clad ruins
of abbeys, churches, and ancient fortresses, delicious scenery, rock-bound
coasts, and celebrated places of England and Wales. It is written by an
author fully competent from travel and reading, and in position to properly
describe his very interesting subject; and the artist's pencil has been called
into requisition to graphically illustrate its well-written pages. There are
487 illustrations, prepared in the highest style of the engraver's art, while
the book itself is one of the most attractive ever presented to the American
public.</p>

<p>Its method of construction is systematic, following the most convenient
routes taken by tourists, and the letter-press includes enough of the history
and legend of each of the places described to make the story highly interesting.
Its pages fairly overflow with picture and description, telling of
everything attractive that is presented by England and Wales. Executed
in the highest style of the printer's and engraver's art, "England, Picturesque
and Descriptive," is one of the best American books of the year.</p></blockquote>

<p>The third volume embraces, without abridgment, the fifth and sixth
volumes of the French edition, and covers one of the most interesting as
well as the most anxious periods of the war, describing the operations of the
Army of the Potomac in the East, and the Army of the Cumberland and
Tennessee in The West.</p>

<p>It contains full accounts of the battle of Chancellorsville, the attack of the
monitors on Fort Sumter, the sieges and fall of Vicksburg and Port Hudson;
the battles of Port Gibson and Champion's Hill, and the fullest and most

Our Civil War. The two volumes in French&mdash;the fifth and sixth&mdash;are bound

through a table of contents of these volumes, published in the cable columns

in several ways. It includes the most important and decisive period of
the war, and the two great campaigns of Gettysburg and Vicksburg.</p>

<p>"The great civil war has had no better, no abler historian than the French
prince who, emulating the example of Lafayette, took part in this new
struggle for freedom, and who now writes of events, in many of which he

position, his high character and eminent talents, was placed in circumstances
and relations which gave him almost unequalled opportunities to
gain correct information and form impartial judgments.</p>

be read with increased interest by Americans because of the importance of
the period it covers and the stirring events it describes. In advance of a
careful review we present to-day some extracts from the advance sheets sent
us by Messrs. Porter &amp; Coates, which will give our readers a foretaste of
chapters which bring back to memory so many half-forgotten and not a few
hitherto unvalued details of a time which Americans of this generation at

<p>The excellent idea of the editor of these choice volumes has been most
admirably carried out, as will be seen by the list of authors upon all subjects.
Selecting some choice passages of the best standard authors, each of sufficient
length to occupy half an hour in its perusal, there is here food for
thought for every day in the year: so that if the purchaser will devote but
one-half hour each day to its appropriate selection he will read through
these six volumes in one year, and in such a leisurely manner that the
noblest thoughts of many of the greatest minds will be firmly in his mind
forever. For every Sunday there is a suitable selection from some of the
most eminent writers in sacred literature. We venture to say if the editor's
idea is carried out the reader will possess more and better knowledge of the
English classics at the end of the year than he would by five years of desultory
reading.</p>

<p>They can be commenced at any day in the year. The variety of reading
is so great that no one will ever tire of these volumes. It is a library in
itself.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Another of the publications of Porter &amp; Coates, called 'The Poetry of
Other Lands,' compiled by N. Clemmons Hunt, we most warmly commend.
It is one of the best collections we have seen, containing many exquisite
poems and fragments of verse which have not before been put into book
form in English words. We find many of the old favorites, which appear
in every well-selected collection of sonnets and songs, and we miss others,
which seem a necessity to complete the bouquet of grasses and flowers,
some of which, from time to time, we hope to republish in the 'Courier.'"&mdash;<i>Cincinnati

<p>"A book of rare excellence, because it gives a collection of choice gems in
many languages not available to the general lover of poetry. It contains
translations from the Greek, Latin, Persian, Arabian, Japanese, Turkish,
Servian, Russian, Bohemian, Polish, Dutch, German, Italian, French,
Spanish, and Portuguese languages. The book will be an admirable companion
volume to any one of the collections of English poetry that are now
published. With the full index of authors immediately preceding the collection,
and the arrangement of the poems under headings, the reader will
find it convenient for reference. It is a gift that will be more valued by
very many than some of the transitory ones at these holiday times."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia

is particularly strong in ballads and tales, which are apt to interest children
more than poems of other kinds; and Mr. Coates has shown good judgment
in supplementing this department with some of the best poems of that class
that have been written for grown people. A surer method of forming the
taste of children for good and pure literature than by reading to them from
any portion of this book can hardly be imagined. The volume is richly
illustrated and beautifully bound."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Evening Bulletin.</i></p>

exquisite poems which our language contains. It must become a standard

<blockquote>

<p>Hood's verse, whether serious or comic&mdash;whether serene like a cloudless
autumn evening or sparkling with puns like a frosty January midnight
with stars&mdash;was ever pregnant with materials for the thought. Like every
author distinguished for true comic humor, there was a deep vein of melancholy
pathos running through his mirth, and even when his sun shone
brightly its light seemed often reflected as if only over the rim of a cloud.</p>

<p>Well may we say, in the words of Tennyson, "Would he could have
stayed with us." for never could it be more truly recorded of any one&mdash;in
the words of Hamlet characterizing Yorick&mdash;that "he was a fellow of infinite
jest, of most excellent fancy."&mdash;<span class="smcap">D.&nbsp;M. Moir.</span>

In parallel columns on each page are given the old and new versions of the
Testament, divided also as far as practicable into comparative verses, so that
it is almost impossible for the slightest new word to escape the notice of
either the ordinary reader or the analytical student. It is decidedly the
best edition yet published of the most interest-exciting literary production
of the day. No more convenient form for comparison could be devised
either for economizing time or labor. Another feature is the foot-notes,
and there is also given in an appendix the various words and expressions

<blockquote>

<p>The wondrous power of Currer Bell's stories consists in their fiery insight
into the human heart, their merciless dissection of passion, and their stern
analysis of character and motive. The style of these productions possesses
incredible force, sometimes almost grim in its bare severity, then relapsing
into passages of melting pathos&mdash;always direct, natural, and effective in its
unpretending strength. They exhibit the identity which always belongs to
works of genius by the same author, though without the slightest approach
to monotony. The characters portrayed by Currer Bell all have a strongly
marked individuality. Once brought before the imagination, they haunt
the memory like a strange dream. The sinewy, muscular strength of her
writings guarantees their permanent duration, and thus far they have lost
nothing of their intensity of interest since the period of their composition.</p></blockquote>

to the Industrial History of Nations. By Prof. <span class="smcap">R. E.
Thompson</span>, of the University of Pennsylvania. 12mo. Cloth,
extra, $1.50.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This book possesses an especial interest at the present moment. The
questions of Free Trade and Protection are before the country more directly
than at any earlier period of our history. As a rule the works and textbooks
used in our American colleges are either of English origin or teach
Doctrines of a political economy which, as Walter Bagehot says, was made
for England. Prof. Thompson belongs to the Nationalist School of Economists,
to which Alexander Hamilton, Tench Coxe, Henry Clay, Matthew
Carey, and his greater son, Henry C. Carey, Stephen Colwell, and James
Abram Garfield were adherents. He believes in that policy of Protection
to American industry which has had the sanction of every great American
statesman, not excepting Thomas Jefferson and John C. Calhoun. He makes
his appeal to history in defence of that policy, showing that wherever a
weaker or less advanced country has practiced Free Trade with one more
powerful or richer, the former has lost its industries as well as its money,
and has become economically dependent on the latter. Those who wish
to learn what is the real source of Irish poverty and discontent will find it
here stated fully.</p>

<p>The method of the book is historical. It is therefore no series of dry and
abstract reasonings, such as repel readers from books of this class. The
writer does not ride the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> nag, and say "this must be so," and "that
must be conceded." He shows what has been true, and seeks to elicit the
laws of the science from the experience of the world. The book overflows
with facts told in an interesting manner.</p></blockquote>

<p>"No similar work in our own or in any other language is for a moment to
be compared with Dr. Smith's Dictionary of the Bible. The Christian and
the scholar have a treasure-house on every subject connected with the
Bible, full to overflowing, and minute even to the telling of mint and cummin."&mdash;<i>London

<p class="book">COMPREHENSIVE BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY. Embracing
accounts of the most eminent persons of all ages, nations,
and professions. By <span class="smcap">E.&nbsp;A. Thomas</span>. Crown 8vo. Cloth, extra,
gilt top, $2.50; sheep, marbled edges, $3.00; half morocco, gilt
top, $3.50; half Russia, gilt top, $4.50.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The aim of the publishers in issuing this work is to present in convenient
size and at moderate price a comprehensive dictionary of biography, embracing
accounts of the most eminent personages in all ages, countries, and
professions.</p>

<p>During the last quarter of a century so many important events have been
enacted, such as the Civil War in America and the Franco-Prussian War of
1870, and such great advances have been made in the line of invention and
scientific investigation, that within that period many persons have risen by
superior merit to conspicuous positions; and as the plan of this work embraces
accounts of the living as well as of the dead, many names are included
that are not to be found in other dictionaries of biography.</p></blockquote>

information on the various subjects on which it treats."&mdash;<i>Harper's Magazine.</i></p>

<p>"This is the best English book on the horse, revised and improved by
competent persons for publication in this country. It is the most complete
work on the subject, probably, in the English language, and that, of course,
means the most complete in existence. Everything relating to a horse that
history, science, observation, or practical knowledge can furnish, has a place
in it."&mdash;<i>Worcester Daily Spy.</i></p></blockquote>

Birds, furnished by Professor Spencer F. Baird, of the Smithsonian Institution;

It is exactly the same size as the larger edition, with the exception that the
engravings are reduced in size and are not colored, reproducing every line
of the original edition. It is one of the best books of permanent value
(strictly an American book) ever published, noted for its beauty of diction
and power of description, pre-eminent as the ablest work on Ornithology,
and now published at a moderate price, that places it within the reach of
